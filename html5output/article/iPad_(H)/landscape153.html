        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Herb was also the first conductor of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra — no, not the present one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">founded in 1948 — one of two under that name (plus many other small orchestras ) appearing and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">disappearing in Winnipeg during the first half of the 20th Century. (Remember,
 we also had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Winnipeg Opera House in the 1890s. It was opera in name only. No Verdi and no
 Wagner. Just trained </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">dogs, lady wrestlers etc. Also our congregation’s first church home!)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Herb was the teacher of Edith Paterson who served as organist in a number of
 Winnipeg churches, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">who later joined the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:2853.59px;top:2272.19px;">Winnipeg Free Press</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5375.78px;top:2272.19px;"> as a columnist in History and wrote several books on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Manitoba history. He also taught such well-known members of our music community,
 as Franklin </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Shinn, Barry Anderson, Allan Borbridge, Beth Cool, Frans Niemeyer, and Eila
 Alford.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Herb, with Hugh Bancroft, Ronald Gibson, and Filmer Hubble established the
 Winnipeg Centre of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Canadian College of organists in 1923 and were its first officers. He was also
 among the first to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">broadcast Organ Recitals over radio station CKY Winnipeg and also acted as
 organist for Vesper Hour, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">broadcast weekly from 1929 through 1938 from St George’s Anglican Church. Above, Herb is in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">middle row, second from the left. This picture was recently found, hanging in
 the choir room of St. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">George’s. Thanks to George Bush for making this copy available. (Mr. Bush once sang in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Westminster’s choir.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">(Radio CKY carried the first Manitoba Church Service broadcast, March 31, 1923.
 Within a few months </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">of this initial broadcast, 16 local churches were wired for broadcasting by
 radio CKY. A record In </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">In his ‘private’ life Herb was company Secretary for Robinson, Little Company, founded in 1875
 in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">London, Ontario. The company began operating department stores in Eastern Canada
 and, having </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">expanded into Western Canada as the ‘big chain of little department stores,’ operated over 180 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Robinson Stores by 1970. How Herb managed his business life and his musical life
 is somewhat of a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">mystery. He wasn’t married. That might have helped.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">Finally, in 1955, lung cancer carried Herb Sadler off. Herb loved to smoke. Half
 way through church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">choir practices a 15 minute recess was always declared. The men of the choir
 retired to the large </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">men’s washroom in the basement of the church for a “spit and a puff.” (Herb’s phrase.) There we </span>
