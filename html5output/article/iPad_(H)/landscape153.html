        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">rendered in the north end of the city … A great deal of the credit must go to Mr. Saddler (sic), the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">organist who was perfect throughout …”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5547.23px;top:318.36px;">  </span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">In 1917 he enlisted in the Army Medical Corps, Dalhousie University Unit,
 serving overseas till the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">end of the war. He then returned briefly to St. George’s until he was appointed as our organist. In </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Herb’s own words: “ In the early fall of 1919, a very self conscious young man, but lately returned
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">from active service in France “aimed at the moon” by applying for the position of organist at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Westminster Church … After an anxious period of waiting ( for this was the most important event in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">the applicant’s musical life so far), there came one day a call to try out … How often he had passed by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">that magnificent facade of Westminster Church, and dreamed that, somehow, one
 day, he might </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">perhaps realize the secret, but nevertheless very real ambition that he might
 become the organist …” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">His official appointment as organist was made in May, 1920.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">By the mid-1920s Herb realized the need to complete his organ training. He
 thereafter studied, first </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">under Hugh Ross and later under Douglas Clarke and Hugh Bancroft. He ultimately
 received both his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">ACCO ( Associate Canadian College of Organists) and FTCL (Fellow Trinity College
 London.) diplomas. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">He then became not only our man but a major ‘player’ in the musical life of Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">He was conductor of The Winnipeg Male Voice Choir-1935 to 1944, the Winnipeg
 Philharmonic Choir </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">(with Filmer Hubble) from 1936 to 1945, and the 85-voice Metropolitan Choir
 (circa 1939-45) where, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">among other repertoire, he conducted Arthur Sullivan’s cantata </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:8814.39px;top:6530.60px;">The Golden Legend</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:11183.87px;top:6530.60px;">. A form of musical </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">theatre was also to his liking with the Metropolitan Choir. They performed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:10308.32px;top:6881.36px;">Scenes from the Song of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:7232.13px;">Hiawatha</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:1250.57px;top:7232.13px;"> — Herb was the composer.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">The review in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:2478.44px;top:7782.89px;">Free Press</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3709.32px;top:7782.89px;"> was not entirely kind,” The performance … held the kind of mistakes </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">which commonly belong on opening night by amateurs, and possibly there were more
 than usual. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">One felt sometimes that the chorus as well as the principals could have done
 better by the composer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-84.00px;top:8835.19px;">… The tenor for </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5232.45px;top:8835.19px;">! had to keep turning his eyes down to a copy of the words </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">(unsuccessfully hidden) … The solo part for Hiawatha was rather sentimentalized; the singer did not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">quite know his Indians … One of the trees was observed to turn over steadily the pages of what might </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">have been a musical score … One or two of the principals seemed to wander on and off the stage </span>
