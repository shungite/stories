        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">At times his unbounded (unrestrained) enthusiasm for his topic would lead him
 dangerously </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">close to exaggeration bordering on misrepresentation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">There’s no doubt that the congregation of Westminster Church cherished him as a
 wonderful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">preacher. The proof, of course was that he filled our sanctuary most Sundays to
 overflowing.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1770.66px;">With a sanctuary seating capacity of 1100 at times the overflow had to be
 accommodated in our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">second floor auditorium and first floor lecture hall seating perhaps another
 couple of hundred. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">The titles or his sermonizing while at Westminster reflect the ideas and
 concerns close to his heart.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">The examples of his writing in the United States reflect the same concerns in
 Theology and World </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Politics that we would have heard in our own sanctuary.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">What follows is an example of Bonnell Oratory that clearly demonstrates his
 unerring choice </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">of vocabulary, his clever use of drama and a remarkable disdain for accuracy.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4626.01px;">Wendell Wilke died. He had been a prominent American lawyer who challenged
 Franklin Roosevelt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">for the office of President in 1940. A Democrat-turned-Republican he lost to
 Democrat Roosevelt. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">But Wilkie was a man or flexible ideals who remade himself to be so politically
 acceptable to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">Roosevelt (ie remade himself as a Democrat) that he became the President’s travelling spokesman, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">an informal ambassador—at—large. After his one defeat he never succeeded in being elected </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">to anything. But as an exceptionally prominent person he fuelled Bonne||’s imagination.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">Wilkie’s funeral was held in Bonnell’s church. The opening paragraph of the Minister’s Eulogy reads </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">as follows: “Seldom have the American people been so shocked and stunned as when tidings
 flashed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">across this nation and around the world that Wendell Wilkie had died. Men and
 women discussed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">the news in hushed tones and with awed voices. In homes of every class, and race
 and creed there </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">was something more than a realization of national deprivation. There was a
 poignant sense of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">personal bereavement.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">Bonnell flies even higher in the rest of the piece. These words from the third
 paragraph: “his hatred </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">of sham and hypocrisy, his unswerving loyalty to principle, his fearless
 independence, his contempt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">for expediency and evasiveness, his genuine humility etc etc.” Bonnell seems to have overlooked </span>
