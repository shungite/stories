    <div id="box3">
        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The console was changed from the original to a more contemporary design </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">in 1951 when we redesigned the whole choir loft.  (Picture below shows choir in the loft in 1960). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">When Herb Sadler died the console was dedicated to him in 1956. Since that time
 the organ ( pipes </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">etc.) has undergone four further renovations (see the Church website under ‘Music’ sub category </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:1570.66px;">‘Casavant Fréres Organ’).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">Going back to 1912</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2672.19px;">The opening service in our new building Sunday, June 16, 1912 was attended by
 1300 people.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3222.95px;">Mr. M.W. Mawer was the choir director and Dr. R.D Fletcher was the organist. The
 choir anthem that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3573.72px;">service was Mendelssohn’s O, Clap Your Hands, suitable for such an exciting occasion.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4124.48px;">A sour note in 1916: There was a discussion at the Session meeting about Choir
 music. The opinion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4475.25px;">was expressed that the Choir was making a mistake by rendering so much high-
 class music to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4826.01px;">exclusion of the hymns that people love to hear and sing. “Give the congregation,” said the speaker, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:5176.77px;">“something that they can continue to sing after leaving Church.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5727.54px;">There was also a threat by Mrs. Fowler, alto soloist, that she would resign from
 the choir if her salary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6078.30px;">was reduced by $150/year.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6629.07px;">Choir Director Mawer’s life was further complicated by a bad relationship between him and soloist </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6979.83px;">Rhynd Jamison. Mr. Jamison lost and was asked to leave.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7530.60px;">Herb at the original console</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8081.36px;">Mr. Mawer was then succeeded as choir director by Ernest Vinen who was hired at
 a salary of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8432.13px;">$1100/year plus an extra $15/year to keep the organ tuned. He left in 1919 when
 Mr. Roy Wideman </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8782.89px;">took over. Herb Sadler took over as organist in 1920 with Mr. Wideman continuing
 as choir director </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9133.66px;">till 1921 when Wideman resigned. Herb was then asked to add choir director to
 his responsibilities </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9484.42px;">on a temporary basis. However, he proved so successful in the dual role he was
 asked to take it on as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9835.19px;">a permanent assignment. Which he continued to do till his death in 1955.
