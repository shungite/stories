        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">He therefore offered the one year position of a probationer-in-training to
 Ernest, whose principal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">qualifications were knowing how to deal with boating under such conditions; plus
 two months of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">uncertain sermonizing in La Scie. Ernest admits “I faced a formidable task with the audacity of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">ignorance.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Ernest ended up serving three widely separate communities, accessible only by
 water, which required </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">him to preach three sermons a week, two on Sunday morning and one late Sunday
 afternoon; those </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">and a weekly prayer service as well. He was now 18 years old. He was also
 expected to visit each of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">his Burgeo parishioners once a month, conduct marriages and funerals (another
 sermon for each.) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">write letters for the illiterate and help them conduct their business. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">He even drafted a will for a dying old man and wrote a petition to the House of
 Parliament (NFLD) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">asking for repairs to the public wharf. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">He was also the doctor’s helper and assisted at surgeries, and amputations. In the outports if a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">person severally damaged a limb, getting to medical help was a often difficult
 to impossible. As result </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">gangrene would set in requiring the amputation. Ernest notes that one time the
 odour of the rotten </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">flesh was so bad he vomited on the spot. Burgeo was no bed of roses.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">Ernest’s stay at Burgeo lasted not one but two years. From there he was moved, still a
 probationer-in-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">training, to Clarke’s Beach for a year. This concluded the three year probationary period he needed
 to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">be accepted as a student for ministry. Thoughts of being a lawyer or a teacher
 were set aside. He was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">now 20 years old.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">His acceptance into training for ministry was a near thing. He had admitted to
 the examining </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">committee to have been reading material written by Harry Emerson Fosdick. Some
 of the examiners </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">felt this was much too modern and possibly suggested a want of appropriate
 character. One member </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">of the committee was able to convince them otherwise. Fosdick would later be one
 of his teachers </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">and his friend.</span>
