        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">So they were an active and vibrant group during the ministries of both McKinnon
 and Christie. And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">then they faded and failed. Fast forward to 1928 and the beginning of the second
 Young Men's Club. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">This was at the tail end of the Christie years with the coming of John
 Sutherland Bonnell to take </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">place in 1929.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">An article in 1937 by Club secretary, Leslie Hunt, starts with a flurry of news
 reports from September </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">1928: “Screeching from out of the Indies a tropical hurricane, like a giant sword
 unsheathed, raced </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">over Florida, cutting down everything in its path and leaving behind 1000 dead
 and 700,000 homeless </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-84.00px;top:2622.95px;">… People in Winnipeg walked the streets in fear as schools remained closed, and
 the death toll from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">dread infantile paralysis slipped past the hundred mark … From far off China, came news of a terrible </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Moslem rebellion, with the massacres’ toll reaching 200,000 … Then Leslie gets down to work and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">switches to good news; the Club’s beginning.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Two men in the congregation, James Crowe (see the article on our founders) and
 Stanley Jones (see </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">the article on The Actimist Club) called together 12 young men on September 25th
 and proposed the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">formation of a Young Men’s Club. Two weeks later the Club was formed with Matt Tennent as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">President. Matt was soon transferred down East and was replaced by Eddie Grant.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Leslie goes on to recount the Club’s activities: to the little settlement of Cormorant, on the Hudson </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">Bay Railway went a bundle of Christmas cheer, gladdening the hearts of 22
 children. From the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">perspective of the 21st Century we picture a group of children spread out on the
 floor stone drunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">from all that “Christmas cheer.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">During the 4th season from the public platform over 50 addresses (speeeches)
 were given to outside </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">organizations and a program of service was launched to country churches. The
 club also held an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:8133.66px;">‘undenominational’ mass meeting in April to 4000 people.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">In 1933 the club, with the help of the YMCA organized “two memorable mass meetings, the principal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">speaker being Dr. Sherwood Eddy. (This event is mentioned in the article on Dr.
 Bonnell.) Leslie </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">indicates that over 6000 people attended. Here, the writer has to recognize that
 Leslie Hunt was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">strong on hyperbole but short on simple honest mathematics. In two meetings he
 would have us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">believe that over 6000 people (seated in Westminster's sanctuary and in the
