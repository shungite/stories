        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">with Immigration Canada was due to run out on June 30th, 2002 and it cost
 $1300.00 for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">application. With the support of the Outreach Committee the money was given to
 them from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Refugee Fund. They have remained in Winnipeg and went on to be excellent
 Canadian citizens.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">The Refugee Committee was recreated again in April, 2014. Phyllis Reader was the
 chair and Val </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">McIntyre was her assistant. (Val at left)They created an application form for “family reunification” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">sponsorship with Westminster United Church. The rationale was the church would
 not be financially </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">responsible for the refugee but the requesting applicant would take full
 responsibility for their family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">member. The Betty Halstead Refugee Fund would act as a slush fund if needed. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">There were several applicants. Phyllis and Val did interviews with recorded
 notes. In all cases the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">applicants proved not to be appropriate for the mandate of the committee.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">The committee is on hold at the present time due to the financial and
 ministerial circumstances of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">the church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">This report is written for the sole purpose of information and archival material
 on Refugee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">Sponsorships at Westminster United Church over the years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:-56.00px;top:5878.30px;">—with our thanks to Phyllis Reader who provided this text.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:6419.32px;">Westminster Young Men’s Club</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7018.92px;">Some things are hard to pin down. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7569.68px;">For example: when did the Young Men's Club get started?</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8120.45px;">We have a report from 1912 (E.B Dearmond, President and T.S. Hamilton,
 Secretary) which suggests </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8471.21px;">that the Young Men’s Club had been in existence for some time — “A number of new members have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8821.98px;">been added, and the old ones knit more closely together …”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9372.74px;">That year they had a Valentine Social. They had a debate with St. Andrew’s Church Club-topic: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:9723.50px;">“Should Canada own and operate a navy?” Dr. Wilson of Augustine Church gave a lecture on Egypt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:10074.27px;">“with lime-light views.” </span>
