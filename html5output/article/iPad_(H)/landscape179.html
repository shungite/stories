        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">You will remember that the grant I am receiving from the United Church of Canada
 is $2,500 a year. I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">have just finished making out the half yearly statement of how the money has
 been used and I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">curious myself to see what information statistics alone would bring forth.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Here they are: with about $620. We have sent 1,406 books to 326 men in prison.
 With less than $700, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">we have given the equivalent of one night’s lodging to about 1,474 men or an average of 4 men for an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">entire year, as well as other financial help to 202 others. The number of
 letters received from men in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">prison was 679 and number sent 907, while 1,420 ex prisoners have been given
 advice about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">everything under the sun, including things spiritual and mundane. We have sent
 men home to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">country when they have wanted to go, we have bought clothes for them when they
 were needed, we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">have set them up in business. We have mended family quarrels, we have brought
 wives as well as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">men back to a sense of duty, we have stayed awake nights thinking of those who
 have gone astray </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">again, and we have stopped at nothing if by all means we might save some.”</span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">Westminster had a very direct connection with a medical missionary, Margaret
 Coltart, R.N. She was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">actually a member of Westminster who served in India. Here is a bit about her
 and her work in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Central India. “Many splendid women medical doctors and nurses have made a contribution as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">labourers in this part of Christ’s vineyard, including Dr. Laura Moodie, Dr. Mina McKenzie, Dr. Maud </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">Smith, Dr. Catherine Whittier, and Dr. Lakshman. Miss Margaret Coltart, RN, now
 in charge, came </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">first to Hat Piplia, India, in 1919, serving till 1924, then from 1930 to 1934
 and returning in 1938. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">During these years both in the hospital and district she has given unstintedly
 of herself and her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">nursing skills, and many improvements have been carried out in the plant. She
 had a hands on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">approach to the nursing station, making the comment: “The day which gave us piped water supply </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">should have been marked in red letters on our calendar.” There are several reports in the archives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">her speaking at the Women’s Missionary Society here at the Church on her visits back to Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">There is also mention of a Miss Dorothy Kilpatrick (BA), in 1914 who was
 commissioned to Central </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">India. She came to Winnipeg from Scotland where her father was appointed a
 professor in Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">College and spent some years in Winnipeg. When she graduated from Toronto
 University, Manitoba </span>
