        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1770.66px;">The Pitblados returned to Westminster later that year in September. During the
 remaining four </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">years of Charles’ ministry, the Pitblados attended two meeting of the Presbyterian Church’s General </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">Assembly, one in Halifax and the other in Ottawa. Charles’ penchant for religious intellectualism  was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">given its due vent when, nearing the end of his life, he was awarded a Doctor of
 Divinity from Gale </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">College in Galesville, Wisconsin. He received his doctorate in 1901, at 65.
 Charles broke through the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">ice and nearly drowned in the winter of 1903 while walking across the Red River
 to St. Boniface. If he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">wasn’t so immersed in contemplating some theological problem to lose all track of his
 surroundings, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">perhaps he’d been gazing up at the imposing basilica of Cathédrale Saint- Boniface, which was by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">then in mid-construction. According to one report, his life was saved by his
 mittens, which had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">frozen to the edge of the hole and kept him from sinking. Now nearly 70 years
 old, and having </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">endured poor health for many years, he decided to throw in the towel; his
 reputation as one of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Winnipeg’s most respected and eminent pastors having long been secured. He retired in
 1904 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">with a retirement allowance of $500 per annum for the following three years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">At Charles’ leaving, there were 316 members in the congregation, and 67,000 people living
 in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Winnipeg. Reverend Dr. Kilpatrick of Manitoba College then served as Interim
 Moderator until April </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">1905, when our second minister, Clarence McKinnon arrived. Pitblado, having once
 more moved to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">California, returned to our city in the summer of 1912. It was arranged that he
 would preach in our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">new building, but his health took another turn for the worse and the sermon he’d prepared was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">never delivered. He returned to California where he died about six months later.
 In December, his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">wife Sophie had his last two sermons, both undelivered, printed and sent to the
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">congregation “…  for the many dear friends to whom both he and I were so deeply attached.”</span>
