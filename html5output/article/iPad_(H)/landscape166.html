        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">lovely lady by the name of Joan Brathwaite (now Joan Wilton) to pick me up. It
 was settled, I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">going.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Joan picked me up and WAS a lovely lady. I remember thinking that if the rest of
 the group was this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">nice, great, the evening would be fine. The evening was fun, chatting with women
 in the same boat </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">as me. Trying to live a Christian life while raising kids and dealing with life’s adventures.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">It wasn’t that long before we (as a group) decided to look after the nursery Sunday
 school, thusly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">meeting more of our Church members and becoming involved. I have a clear memory
 of making </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:2822.95px;">‘fancy’ sandwiches at Lorrie’s house for the Annual Fall Bazaar (maybe it was the spring tea) and that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">skill has served me well through the years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">As a group we were definitely each other’s significant others when the need arose. This has proven </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">true to this day. We are so lucky. But mostly I remember having fun. Dinners
 with the Husbands </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">(once again at Lorrie’s house — she had the largest home at the time or was the first to volunteer to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">host). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">I truly believe that because of Unit I, became more involved with WUC. We all
 did. We welcomed new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">members to our group and said goodbye to others. We chose studies that were
 relevant to our lives </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">and shared thoughts and feelings this way.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6579.83px;">Unit 10, too, is still going strong, celebrating their 50 year mark as a unit
 within the church, Phyllis </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">Reader reports. They are going to the Temple Gardens Spa in Moose Jaw to
 celebrate this auspicious </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">occasion at the end of the month! Unit 10 meets once a month during the winter
 months and has a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">special dinner at Christmas and spring. Liz Witjkamp, Rita Menzies, Val
 McIntyre, Lynn Heise and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">Ann Peeler have been members since the beginning. Phyllis goes on to say the
 group “was a great </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">support, as members went through the various stages of life, career changes,
 raising kids, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">grandchildren, weddings, funerals and parents passing away. We did our share of
 teas and helping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">with after church luncheons, garage sales, and contributions of home baking for
 a host of events. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">We've been through it all and have developed very strong, loyal relationships
 over the years. We met </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">in members homes once a month. Discussed church business and all of us have
 served on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">various committees and the church board. In fact they are now recycling us
 again.”</span>
