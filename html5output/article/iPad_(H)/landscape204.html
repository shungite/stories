        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">To return as senior minister after fourteen years was both an interesting and
 overwhelming (if not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">frightening) experience. As the young assistant (I was only thirty-two when we
 first went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Westminster in 1946), I had been given quite wide-ranging responsibilities. Dr.
 Howse was an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">excellent senior minister, and one never had the feeling of simply being the
 assistant to the minister. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">I, too, was a minister, and he had the happy faculty of inspiring confidence in
 me by the way in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">which he left whole areas of work for me to do. He was always available when I
 wanted (or needed) to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">consult with him, but I never felt that he was peeking around the corner to see
 what I was doing. I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">had work to do, and he left me to it: the overall Christian education program,
 Sunday and mid-week, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">work with new members and confirmation classes, home and hospital visiting, and
 a limited amount </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">of preaching, except in the summer when I preached morning and evening from the
 last Sunday in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">June to Labour Day Sunday. In the summer, of course, I was in charge of all the
 work of the church—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3826.01px;">Sunday services, weddings, funerals, hospital visiting — the whole bit.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">So, to return fourteen years later as senior minister gave opportunity for much
 reminiscing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">those three years as assistant. The young people of the forties were now mature
 adults, and as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">doctors and dentists and lawyers and housewives and teachers and business
 leaders, they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">active in the church as elders and stewards and UCW presidents. As the years
 moved along, I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">conducting the funerals of elderly parishioners whom I had first known in the
 heyday of their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">working years. Two young lads whom I had confirmed graduated in law and were now
 “on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">bench.” Others had moved on in one profession or another, taking an active part in the
 family  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">business, or establishing their own. As I said, it was somewhat frightening to
 return to Westminster, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">but it turned out to be a most challenging and fulfilling—and lengthy—pastorate.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">I mentioned earlier, in the section on Lakeview, that I recognized the
 demographic changes that were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">coming in that congregation. At Westminster, I had the opportunity to witness
 the changes that had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">already taken place. In the late 1940s, the change was beginning. Young people
 coming out of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">Armed Forces were looking for property in the suburbs. The bulk of our
 congregation in those years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">still lived mostly in the Westminster-Fort Rouge-River Heights areas, with only
 relatively few as far </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">out as Fort Garry or Deer Lodge. Subdivisions like Silver Heights, Kirkfield
 Park, and Windsor Park </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">were only names. Oxford, Westworth, and Trinity Churches were nonexistent.
