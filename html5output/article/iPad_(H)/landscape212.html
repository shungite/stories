        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The pulpit supply committee had arranged for Sunday services for July 1979, but
 since we were in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">town, I had offered to take funerals and weddings, and it turned out to be one
 of those very busy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">months. But I was not about to leave people scrambling to find someone to
 conduct a funeral, or to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">have a stranger for their wedding when we were in the city anyway. So it worked
 out okay.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">As an appendix to this chapter I shall include my second-last sermon at
 Westminster, which I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">entitled, “The First Forty Years are the Hardest.” There will not be much overlapping with what has </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">been written thus far, but perhaps it gives a kind of summary. (Let me confess
 here that ten years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">later, in 1989, when I was completing my second post-retirement job, at
 Metropolitan in London, I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">used almost exactly the same sermon, simply changing the title to “The First Fifty Years are the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Hardest.”)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">But just before the Appendix, I must relate what appeared in the Westminster
 Church calendar on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">my last Sunday, and this actually found its way into a September 1979 issue of
 PUNCH magazine in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">England.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">I had given the church secretary the general outline for the calendar material,
 including hymns, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">lessons, sermon subject, etc. And then I said, “Why not indicate that it’s my last Sunday at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Westminster?”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">Later in the week, the organist phoned in the music for Sunday, including the
 titles for prelude, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">offertory and postlude. When the calendar appeared, this is how it read:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">         </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:720.00px;top:7281.36px;">Sunday. June 24, 1979</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">         </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:720.00px;top:7632.13px;">Dr. Vipond’s last Sunday at Westminster</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">         </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:720.00px;top:7982.89px;">Organ Prelude: “Now Thank We All Our God”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8533.66px;">Apparently, someone from Britain was visiting Westminster that day and showed
 PUNCH the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">calendar! Is there such a thing as a Freudian slip? The case rests!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:9425.44px;">The Westminster Children's Care Centre Inc</span>
