        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">members of the congregation could be, and were, asked to serve the elements on
 Communion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Sunday. The UCW had no secret agenda, because there was no UCW! The units were
 still meeting, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">but they came under the fellowship committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1019.89px;">the visitation was arranged by the membership and visiting committee. And, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1370.66px;">best of all, we were finding new people every year to become board members, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1721.42px;">and all the board members were aware of all the work in the church. In short, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2072.19px;">we became a much more open society. And with this new breath of fresh air </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2422.95px;">blowing in the church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief reason, I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2773.72px;">think, why I found it easy to continue on at Westminster for a few more years, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3124.48px;">and eventually till retirement when I reached age sixty-five in 1979.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3675.25px;">There were changes in our household, too. Doug, who had enrolled in Grade 9 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4026.01px;">at River Heights Junior High when we came to Winnipeg in 1963, went on to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4376.77px;">Kelvin High and then to do his BA at the University of Winnipeg, graduating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">with the gold medal for highest standing in the general arts course. He had
 worked each summer (on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">the end of a hoe) at the University of Manitoba farm, and had a bank account to
 go to York University </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">in Toronto in the fall of 1970 to pursue a PhD in psychology. So, in our huge
 manse at 141 Waterloo </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Street (3,200 square feet of floor space and a 100 × 150 foot property), we were down to one family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">member at home. Rob had proceeded through elementary, junior high, and was now
 (1970–1971) in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">his final year at Kelvin High School and had made his decision to go east for
 his university work. We </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">certainly didn’t need this huge manse. Dorothy was already on part-time staff at Laura Second
 as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">teacher-librarian, having taken the necessary five courses at U of M. A smaller
 home would suit us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">better. It would also give us opportunity to get some equity in a house, so that
 upon retirement we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">wouldn’t simply leave the keys on the kitchen counter and face the prospect of having
 to buy a home </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8235.19px;">at that late stage.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">I spoke to some of the people on the board who had been around for years about
 buying our own </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">house, although I assured them that if the congregation felt strongly about
 retaining its manse we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">could no doubt accommodate ourselves to their decision. Fortunately, the church
 board was very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">happy to get out of the property business. The manse was sold. We purchased a
 very suitable three-</span>
