        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">serve a four-year term, and the chair would change every second year. Each of
 the nine committees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">could add to their numbers for their own committee tasks, but all major
 decisions would be brought </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">to the monthly meeting of the General Board for final approval. This obviously
 is a very brief </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1019.89px;">description of a very major change in congregational government. (The text of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1370.66px;">the constitution is in my Westminster file.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1921.42px;">I have included this summary of our church board restructuring because it </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2272.19px;">changed in a major way the focus of my work at Westminster. It gave a whole </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2622.95px;">new direction to the life and work of the congregation. I was really impressed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2973.72px;">with the way in which a structure, or system of government, can change the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3324.48px;">life of a church. For many years, the congregation seemed to be pulled in three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3675.25px;">directions by the Session, by the UCW, and by the Stewards. Now, there was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4026.01px;">only one board. There were no financial secrets tucked away in the Stewards’ </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4376.77px;">safekeeping. There was no Session, so any members of the congregation could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">be, and were, asked to serve the elements on Communion Sunday. The UCW had no
 secret agenda, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">because there was no UCW! The units were still meeting, but they came under the
 fellowship </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but the visitation was arranged by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">membership and visiting committee. And, best of all, we were finding new people
 every year to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">become board members, and all the board members were aware of all the work in
 the church. In </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">short, we became a much more open society. And with this new breath of fresh air
 blowing in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief reason, I think, why I found
 it easy to continue on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">at Westminster for a few more years, and eventually till retirement when I
 reached age sixty-five in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">1979.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">There were changes in our household, too. Doug, who had enrolled in Grade 9 at
 River Heights Junior </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">High when we came to Winnipeg in 1963, went on to Kelvin High and then to do his
 BA at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">University of Winnipeg, graduating with the gold medal for highest standing in
 the general arts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">course. He had worked each summer (on the end of a hoe) at the University of
 Manitoba farm, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">had a bank account to go to York University in Toronto in the fall of 1970 to
 pursue a PhD in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">psychology. So, in our huge manse at 141 Waterloo Street (3,200 square feet of
