        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">setting up a new board structure, we had to make certain that all the work of
 the congregation would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">be covered, yet not duplicated. Also, we wanted to make certain that there would
 be a good mix of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">women, men, and young people on the board. We wanted to be certain, too, that
 there would be a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">time limit for any one person to serve.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">We began the discussion and study of a possible new structure of congregational
 government at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">beginning of 1969, and the final report was presented to the congregational
 meeting in January 1970. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">It was approved. The General Board (as we decided to call it) would be made up
 of nine committees, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">with four persons on each committee—worship, education, finance, property, communications, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">membership and visiting, fellowship, outreach, and nominations. There would also
 be a chairperson, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">vice chair, secretary, and treasurer, with the staff as ex officio members. Each
 board member would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">serve a four-year term, and the chair would change every second year. Each of
 the nine committees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">could add to their numbers for their own committee tasks, but all major
 decisions would be brought </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">to the monthly meeting of the General Board for final approval. This obviously
 is a very brief </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">description of a very major change in congregational government. (The text of
 the constitution is in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">my Westminster file.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">I have included this summary of our church board restructuring because it
 changed in a major way </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">the focus of my work at Westminster. It gave a whole new direction to the life
 and work of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">congregation. I was really impressed with the way in which a structure, or
 system of government, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">can change the life of a church. For many years, the congregation seemed to be
 pulled in three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">directions by the Session, by the UCW, and by the Stewards. Now, there was only
 one board. There </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">were no financial secrets tucked away in the Stewards’ safekeeping. There was no Session, so any </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">members of the congregation could be, and were, asked to serve the elements on
 Communion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">Sunday. The UCW had no secret agenda, because there was no UCW! The units were
 still meeting, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">but they came under the fellowship committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">the visitation was arranged by the membership and visiting committee. And, best
 of all, we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">finding new people every year to become board members, and all the board members
 were aware of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">all the work in the church. In short, we became a much more open society. And
 with this new breath </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">of fresh air blowing in the church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief
 reason, I think, why I </span>
