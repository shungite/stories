        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">part of the city I would live in.I dropped into Westminster one September
 evening and was delighted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">to find that a Boys' Conference was being held and the speaker was Mr. Taylor
 Staten. He is the man </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">who started Tuxis and Trail Rangers — a great friend of mine. He spotted me in the congregation and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">told the Conference the story of three lads from Calgary who came to the Lake of
 The Woods in 1910 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">to a Boys’ Conference. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">He related that two of them had given their lives in the First World War, and he
 had had a visit with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">the remaining one a few months earlier while lecturing to troops during the
 march of occupation in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Germany; I had obtained leave and had travelled 20 kilometres to listen to my
 friend. Taylor Staten </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">then asked me to come up to the pulpit and say a few words. Although that was my
 introduction to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Westminster, I really had the Westminster table pinned on me many years before I
 ever heard of this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">The next evening a group of 12 year old lads called at my room in the Y and
 invited me to come as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">their teacher. An auspicious start.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">Westminster has always had grand ministers and very able associates. When pulpit
 supply was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">required, outstanding ministers or laymen fro all corners of the east preached.
 They included our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">own church missionary from China and our own Sunday School missionary from
 India.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">A large Bible was kept on the pulpit which visitors and preachers signed. Names
 such as Dr. Grenfell  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">of Labrador, Ramsey MacDonald, former Prime Minister of Britain, Rev. Professor
 Moffat (translator of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">the Bible) and many others signed. Sad to relate vandal stole that historic
 Bible and it has never been </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">recovered.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">Times and customs of dress change. On a hot Sunday in June, 1923, I was inducted
 as an elder.It was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">usual to wear a dark suit, tie, etc. and white shirt. My suited been to the
 cleaners and it reeked of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">gasoline. The new elder next to me kept sniffing during the ceremony. I was warm
 enough on that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">hot Sunday, but became more uncomfortable when the minister announced the title
 of his sermon; </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">he kept repeating it and seemed to look my way each time. The title of the
 sermon was ‘Christian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">Fragrance.’</span>
