 not enough space!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">In the event the club thrived till well into the 40s when WWII called away young
 men for service </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">overseas.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1419.89px;">This picture of the Club’s 1934 executive includes a number of names of people who became </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1770.66px;">prominent in Winnipeg in later years. Two names that immediately spring to mind
 are Gurzon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">Harvey who served on Winnipeg’s City Council for 26 years. The other is Aiden Conklin, 35 years as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">School Trustee in St. James, Reeve of the Municipality of Victoria Beach,
 recipient of the Queen </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal for Community service in 1977 and an inductee
 into The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Order of The Buffalo Hunt in 1980. Aiden’s daughter Liz Wijtkamp is presently an active member of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Westminster Church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:4065.50px;">R.D. — In His Own Words</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4665.09px;">R.D. (Bert) Macfarlane represents a significant portion of the congregation
 which has always been the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5015.86px;">back bone of a successful Church- dedicated volunteers; the tireless men and
 women who  run our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5366.62px;">programs and shoulder responsibilities for — among many reasons — the joy of serving. R.D. worked  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5717.39px;">in our Sunday School and our Athletic program for young people. He edited a
 newsletter for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6068.15px;">years. He also fathered a girl who became, like himself, a leader every bit as
 strong as her father; </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6969.68px;">Bert can tell his own story. The Annual Meeting he alludes to in the beginning
 took place in 1972 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7320.45px;">during the Ministry of Reid Vipond, the same year this document was written …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:7871.21px;">“At the Annual Meeting of Westminster held in the Sanctuary this year Dr. Vipond
 was kind enough </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8221.98px;">to draw attention to the fact that I had completed 53 years of activity in this
 church and invited the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">congregation to give suitable recognition. I am deeply grateful to our minister
 for making this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">reference.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9474.27px;">Fifty three years is a short period in life’s record and I have enjoyed every bit of it and am thankful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9825.04px;">that I had the opportunity of being associated with such fine people in serving
 the Master.</span>
