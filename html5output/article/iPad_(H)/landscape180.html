 Westminster Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">contributed largely to her support in India. Miss Kilpatrick became very
 proficient in Hindi. She went </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">on to write a book of Indian Folk tales.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">In 1953, a committee was established by the General Council of The United Church
 of Canada to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">study women’s work in the church with the goal of formally recognizing the work and
 contribution of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">United Church women. In 1956, the 17th General Council initiated the Commission
 on the Work of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Women in the Church and the findings and recommendations of the commission were
 released in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">1960 with the birth of United Church Women. General Council took action to
 ensure that women </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">could share in a much more meaningful way in all the work of the church by
 allowing them to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">participate on the boards of The United Church at all levels. Approval was given
 to this organization, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">United Church Women (UCW), at the General Council meeting held in Edmonton,
 Alberta, in 1960 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">with UCW officially came into being on January 1, 1962. Its purpose was: To
 unite women of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">congregation for the total mission of the church and to provide a medium through
 which we may </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">express our loyalty and devotion to Jesus Christ in Christian witness, study,
 fellowship and service.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">And so we find that here at Westminster the amalgamation of the Women’s Missionary Society and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">the Women’s Association, coming together in the early 1960s and created 19 women’s groups with a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">mandate to involve more women in church activities. The inaugural service of the
 newly formed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">Westminster UCW was organized by Marilyn Huband in October 1962.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">(See UCW Scrapbook items at the end of this article.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">These women’s groups, later known as ‘Women’s Units,’ were part of Westminster life for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">decades — creating opportunities for social interaction and raising money for specific
 projects such as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">knitting sweaters, packaging baby layettes, purchasing supplies for baby quilts
 (all to be sent to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Buelah Burns mission in China) and filling Christmas hampers. The Units were
 responsible not only </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">for organizing church luncheons, bazaars and study groups, but also for
 coordinating after-church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">fellowship coffee time. Every spring, all units would get together for a Potluck
 Supper and an evening </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">of socializing and fellowship at the church. At one such event, the ladies
 presented a bridal fashion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">show, organized by Jo Brown, where a number of the younger members paraded
 merrily through the </span>
