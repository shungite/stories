        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">From 1912 through to the 1950s emphasis on different sport teams and on
 sport-based activity clubs </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">changed from year to year. The amount of over-all activity was amazing. Yet none
 of it seemed to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">lack for enthusiastic membership or capable leadership. The answer to “why” lay in the fact that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Westminster Church had a congregation of well over one thousand people. Twelve
 hundred, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">fifteen/sixteen/seventeen hundred people in what, for a time, was considered the
 largest Presbyterian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">church in Western Canada. And all this physical activity was going on both in
 our gymnasium and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">outside the building. A very small sample …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">We had started an indoor Baseball league that was interrupted by WW I but was
 reorganized in 1919. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">At that time the Choir agreed to put up a team. We looked for teams to be
 entered from the Boys </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Department of the Sunday School, the Young Mens’ Club, the Bible Class. and from the men of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">congregation generally. To encourage the fresh start-up Mr. O.B. Knight donated
 a cup for competition </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">among these indoor baseball players. The games were played on Tuesday and Friday
 evenings.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">Our Young Mens’ Club reported in 1913 that, in the line of sport, they, “as usual”, took a prominent </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">part, winning the Hockey Cup, and making what they allowed was a fair showing on
 the football </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">field. Meanwhile, in another sport, snow-shoeing, it was reported that there had
 been very little snow </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">the winter of 1912. But during the winter of 1913 there was plenty and the
 Snow-Shoe Club became </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">very popular.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">Basketball, baseball, football, hockey, snow-shoeing : in 1919 a tennis club was
 formed. By 1933 the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Westminster Tennis courts ( located at Balmoral and Young) had to be enlarged
 and improved. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Reservations for the membership could be made through V.C. Grant. Later on we
 would add </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">badminton to our sports roster as well. We also had a church league for bowling
 (games played </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">Tuesday and Thursday nights at the YMCA).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Basketball seems to have been a major obsession over many years. Our gym was
 equipped with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">basketball hoops at either end. The size of the court would have been 37'6" by
 about 15'. Consider </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">that size against what is regarded today as a standard high school court (84 X
 50 ft.) The style of play </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">and the overall appearance of the game would only marginally resemble what we
 see today in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">shrines to Basketball where professional NBA games are televised!</span>
