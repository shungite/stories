        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">University of Winnipeg, graduating with the gold medal for highest standing in
 the general arts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">course. He had worked each summer (on the end of a hoe) at the University of
 Manitoba farm, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">had a bank account to go to York University in Toronto in the fall of 1970 to
 pursue a PhD in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">psychology. So, in our huge manse at 141 Waterloo Street (3,200 square feet of
 floor space and a 100 × </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">150 foot property), we were down to one family member at home. Rob had proceeded
 through </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">elementary, junior high, and was now (1970–1971) in his final year at Kelvin High School and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">made his decision to go east for his university work. We certainly didn’t need this huge manse. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">Dorothy was already on part-time staff at Laura Second as teacher-librarian,
 having taken the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">necessary five courses at U of M. A smaller home would suit us better. It would
 also give us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">opportunity to get some equity in a house, so that upon retirement we wouldn’t simply leave the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">keys on the kitchen counter and face the prospect of having to buy a home at
 that late stage.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">I spoke to some of the people on the board who had been around for years about
 buying our own </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">house, although I assured them that if the congregation felt strongly about
 retaining its manse we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">could no doubt accommodate ourselves to their decision. Fortunately, the church
 board was very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">happy to get out of the property business. The manse was sold. We purchased a
 very suitable three-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">bedroom bungalow at 718 Waterloo Street, and one of Rob’s last jobs at home before going to U of T </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">was to help us with the back-breaking job of moving our goods and chattels just
 five blocks down the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">street.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">We hired movers, of course, to move the piano, living room and bedroom furniture
 and appliances, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">but did the rest ourselves. And we did it all in one day, June 30, 1971. The
 people from whom we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">bought didn’t move out till June 29, and the people who bought 141 wanted to move in on July
 1. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">With a rented two-wheel trailer, and the help of some of Rob’s friends with a station wagon, we made </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">an untold number of trips up and down Waterloo Street. Loads of books, the
 bricks and boards from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">our homemade shelves, all our dishes (packed by Dorothy), all our clothes still
 on hangers, bedding, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">pictures off the walls, plants in their pots, groceries from the shelves, lawn
 mower and wheel barrow </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">and stepladder... and the list goes on. We took the last trailer load at
 midnight. Dorothy had made up </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">the beds in our new home. And I set the alarm for 7:30 a.m. so I could return
 the rented trailer at 8 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">a.m. the next morning! It was small comfort to have the new owners of 141 come
 by that evening as </span>
