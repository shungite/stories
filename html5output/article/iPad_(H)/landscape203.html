        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">married Harold Atwell from Trinidad, and when he finished his studies at the
 University of Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">they moved to Trinidad. Glenys Hughes, also from Covenant College, succeeded
 Susan, and less than </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">two years later married Rev. Harry Oussoren and moved back to Toronto. Barbara
 Bryant also came to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">us when she completed her two-year course at Covenant College, but stayed for
 only one year. Upon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">leaving Westminster, Barbara attended Seneca       College in Toronto and graduated in early </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">childhood education. She married a minister and they serve jointly on a pastoral
 charge in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">Saskatchewan.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">When Barbara was leaving, and Jack Mathieson retired, the board decided we
 should move into a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">new staffing arrangement and they called a relatively young ordained minister,
 Cecil Tiller. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">seemed anxious to move west from Saint John, New Brunswick, and to undertake a
 role similar to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">the one that I had earlier done at Westminster, i.e., to be an associate
 minister with major </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">responsibility for Christian education, to do as much visiting as possible, and
 to preach once each </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">month. This arrangement seemed to work well for a year or two, but Cec began to
 realize that he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">really preferred preaching to CE work, and accepted a call to St. Andrew’s Church in Regina after two </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">years at Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">At this point, we changed direction quite considerably in our staffing, and
 decided to hire three staff </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">people working one-third time each. Joan McConnell, who had been a teacher
 before she and Barry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">had four children, was our Sunday school superintendent, and she became our
 director of Christian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">education. Audrey McLennan, who, before she and Norm had their three boys, had
 been a program </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">director at the YWCA, was anxious to get back into part-time work and was happy
 to work one-third </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">time as outreach coordinator. Rev. Bill Conly, just retired after serving all
 his forty years in Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">became our one-third-time retired visiting assistant. The four of us formed a
 very happy working </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">relationship, each with her or his special responsibilities. Bill Conly’s wife, Irene, was one of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">Westminster Riddell family, so for them it was like coming home. Bill was with
 us until my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">retirement in 1979. Joan McConnell went with Barry to Britain for a year’s sabbatical in 1978, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">Elaine Hickerson, wife of Rev. Bill Hickerson, secretary of Manitoba conference,
 came as her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">replacement. Audrey McLennan also left in 1978 to work full- time at her home
 church, Fort Garry, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">and Orma Backhouse replaced her. Partly as a footnote, and as a point of
 interest, Joan McConnell is </span>
