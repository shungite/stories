 Zolf calls </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:318.36px;">“Winnipeg’s nort’end.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">What a change we witnessed (and were part of) in our second tour of duty at
 Westminster! I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">remember well that day early in July 1963, as we drove into Winnipeg from the
 west: homes and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">stores and schools and churches right out to Kirkfield Park; there were
 apartment houses (albeit </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">mostly three-storey walk-ups); Polo Park shopping mall already established at
 Portage and St. James; </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">and hard by the St. James bridge overpass, the spanking new multi-storey
 Kiltarton Towers. Soon, we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">were to discover “Winnipeg’s finest” — the Edinburgh House on Wellington Crescent, and, as they say </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">in almost every advertisement, “much, much more.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">In a sense we were not fully prepared for the traumatic change at Westminster.
 Before we left </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Lakeview we had canvassed the possibility of having a seniors’ club, but there were so few members </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">over sixty-five or seventy that such a club was considered neither necessary nor
 viable. In contrast, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">one of the most active groups at Westminster was the “Sunshine Club,” sixty or seventy-five seniors </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">who met every Friday afternoon, played cards, put on their own programs, and
 danced to the music </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">of their own orchestra. Their Christmas turkey dinner and June picnic swelled
 their numbers to over </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">one hundred.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">Doris Marshall was the staff person in charge of senior programming, and later
 (because she was a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">trained deaconess) added Christian education to her busy portfolio and gave
 excellent service to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Westminster. By December, Mack MacIver, just retired from the air force
 chaplaincy with the rank of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">wing commander, joined our staff on a three-quarter time basis. A most affable
 Cape Bretoner, Mack </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">was with us for five happy years. Following a very lengthy and debilitating
 illness with multiple </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">sclerosis, his wife, Charlotte, died. Mack remarried, and he and Myrtle remain
 two of our very good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">Winnipeg friends.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">We had a succession of staff members. When Mack retired, Jack Mathieson, who had
 served in North </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">Honan, China, was with us for three years. When Doris Marshall moved to Toronto
 to be near her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">family and to do senior adult programming for the United Church, Susan Cawley
 became our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">deaconess. She was a recent graduate from Covenant College and was with us for
 two years. Susan </span>
