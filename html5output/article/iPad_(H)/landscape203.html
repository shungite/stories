        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">pictures off the walls, plants in their pots, groceries from the shelves, lawn
 mower and wheel barrow </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">and stepladder... and the list goes on. We took the last trailer load at
 midnight. Dorothy had made up </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">the beds in our new home. And I set the alarm for 7:30 a.m. so I could return
 the rented trailer at 8 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">a.m. the next morning! It was small comfort to have the new owners of 141 come
 by that evening as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">we were frantically trying to finish our hectic day’s work to assure us that there really was no hurry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">after all. They had decided to have some redecoration done, and the painters
 weren’t coming for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">several days. Oh well, you can’t win ‘em all.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">I like to add footnotes, and this time there are two. First, don’t ever try to do your own moving, even </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">if it is only five blocks away. And, second, we certainly didn’t realize at the time how extremely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">fortunate we were to have purchased our home when we did. We bought 718 Waterloo
 in 1971 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">$23,900, and, exactly ten years later, sold it for $67,000. What a boon to have
 cash in hand to buy our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">retirement home in London, a much better home in every way, and almost
 completely paid for by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">sale of 718 Waterloo.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">There were at least two important decisions regarding property and finances made
 by the trustees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">and board at Westminster in our time there. First, the old manse at 120 Maryland
 Street was being </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">used by Manitoba conference as the office for the conference staff and the
 resource centre. (141 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">Waterloo had been bought as a manse in about 1958.) After fairly lengthy
 negotiations with the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">conference executive, Westminster agreed to tear down the old manse and build a
 two-storey office </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">building to serve the conference needs. This was accomplished in 1964. The
 conference rent is used </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">to pay off the $80,000 mortgage on the office building, so it has been a win-win
 situation for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">church. The mortgage is just about paid off at this point (1992), and from now
 on, the conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">rental will become church income for Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">Second, about 1965 I suggested that we should set up a foundation fund for the
 church. There were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">always people asking if there was some particular need toward which a memorial
 contribution could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">be made. Also, there were three or four small trust funds (not more than a total
 of $10,000–$15,000) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">and they were carried along year after year, reported at the annual meeting, but
 never used. No one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">quite knew what to do with them. It was my feeling that if there were a
 Foundation Fund properly set </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">up and publicized, there would be contributions made to it. Perhaps some people
 might put it into </span>
