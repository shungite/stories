        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Westminster had a very direct connection with a medical missionary, Margaret
 Coltart, R.N. She was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">actually a member of Westminster who served in India. Here is a bit about her
 and her work in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Central India. “Many splendid women medical doctors and nurses have made a contribution as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">labourers in this part of Christ’s vineyard, including Dr. Laura Moodie, Dr. Mina McKenzie, Dr. Maud </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Smith, Dr. Catherine Whittier, and Dr. Lakshman. Miss Margaret Coltart, RN, now
 in charge, came </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">first to Hat Piplia, India, in 1919, serving till 1924, then from 1930 to 1934
 and returning in 1938. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">During these years both in the hospital and district she has given unstintedly
 of herself and her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">nursing skills, and many improvements have been carried out in the plant. She
 had a hands on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">approach to the nursing station, making the comment: “The day which gave us piped water supply </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">should have been marked in red letters on our calendar.” There are several reports in the archives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">her speaking at the Women’s Missionary Society here at the Church on her visits back to Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">There is also mention of a Miss Dorothy Kilpatrick (BA), in 1914 who was
 commissioned to Central </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">India. She came to Winnipeg from Scotland where her father was appointed a
 professor in Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">College and spent some years in Winnipeg. When she graduated from Toronto
 University, Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">still considered that she belonged to this Province and the Sunday School of
 Westminster Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">contributed largely to her support in India. Miss Kilpatrick became very
 proficient in Hindi. She went </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">on to write a book of Indian Folk tales.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">In 1953, a committee was established by the General Council of The United Church
 of Canada to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">study women’s work in the church with the goal of formally recognizing the work and
 contribution of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">United Church women. In 1956, the 17th General Council initiated the Commission
 on the Work of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Women in the Church and the findings and recommendations of the commission were
 released in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">1960 with the birth of United Church Women. General Council took action to
 ensure that women </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">could share in a much more meaningful way in all the work of the church by
 allowing them to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">participate on the boards of The United Church at all levels. Approval was given
 to this organization, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">United Church Women (UCW), at the General Council meeting held in Edmonton,
 Alberta, in 1960 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">with UCW officially came into being on January 1, 1962. Its purpose was: To
 unite women of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">congregation for the total mission of the church and to provide a medium through
 which we may </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">express our loyalty and devotion to Jesus Christ in Christian witness, study,
 fellowship and service.</span>
