        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">When the United Church officially formed in 1925, the Ladies Aid (LA) (later the
 Woman’s Association </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">(WA)) and the Women’s Missionary Society (WMS) were doing work at home and abroad. The WA </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">focused on supporting the local church and community, while the WMS was more
 involved with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">education and world mission.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">When Westminster congregation was created in 1892 some of the first groups (or
 clubs) to form </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">were Missional in focus, a Women’s Missionary group, a Young Women's Missionary group, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">later a Pitblado Missionary group. The major task of Church outreach was in the
 hands of its women. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">At the same time women of our church continued their traditional roles as
 teachers, fundraisers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">and organizers of social functions, teas and dinners.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">By 1925 all these various tasks were formalized (as the introduction mentions)
 as the WA </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Women’s Association (Organized into 19 circles, women’s activity and social groups, once operated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">in Westminster) and the WMS Women's Missionary Society. Also, falling naturally
 under the WA, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">the work of quilting and sewing for local hospitals, for troops overseas , and
 other groups in need </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">was part of the ongoing contribution of our women. This general form of
 organization obtained until </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">the late 1950s when the United Church rethought the whole role of women in the
 church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">The conclusion of this rethinking was that it was time for women to be involved
 in the total </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">mission of the Church, not only in their historical roles but also in ground
 level maintenance </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">and administration of the church at all its levels, General Council,
 Conferences, Presbyteries and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Congregations. Out with Sessions and Elders (the province of Men alone) in with
 general boards </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">with equal participation, women and men. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">Even the Moderator could be a woman. Westminster’s own Lois Wilson  (pictured here  with her Dad, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Dr. E.G.D. “Dink” Freeman, was the first to be so honoured. (1980-1982)  (Lois’s Mom was an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">inexhaustible  leader in our Sunday School and C.G.I.T. for a number of years.) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">This change in thinking was formalized in January 1st of 1962 as ‘United Church Women.’ The stated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">purpose of this new grouping: “To unite women of the congregation for the total mission of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">church and to provide a medium through which we may express our loyalty and
 devotion to Jesus </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">Christ in Christian witness, study, fellowship and service.”</span>
