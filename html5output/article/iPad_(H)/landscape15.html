        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">of Governors from 1897 to 1914, the year of his passing. Given his background,
 our reader shouldn’t </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">be surprised to discover that Colin was also a member of the St. Charles Country
 Club, the Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Club, the Adanac Club, and the Winnipeg Burns Club. He was widely sought after
 for his acumen </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-56.00px;top:1721.42px;">— and clout — and was one of the more influential men in that group of 18 men who, on October
 24th, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">1892, convened in his office to work out plans for a new Presbyterian Church in
 Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:2613.20px;">FREDERICK HARSTONE, BUSINESSMAN</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:3212.80px;">Like many of Westminster’s founders, Frederick was born (1865) and educated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:3563.56px;">in Ontario before relocating to Winnipeg in hot pursuit of the opportunities
 that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:3914.33px;">were surfacing here for industrial pioneerism. He spent his public school years
 in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:4265.09px;">his native Roseneath, and was further educated at the Toronto Business College. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:4615.86px;">In the early 1900s, now living in Winnipeg, Frederick established a fuel
 business, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:4966.62px;">specialized in coal and wood. After the untimely death of his business partner
 and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2380.00px;top:5317.39px;">brother, the firm was reorganized as the Harstone Coal Company. They had their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5668.15px;">offices at the Leckie Building (216 McDermott), later becoming the Harstone
 Building — which still </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6018.92px;">stands, but is, like too many heritage buildings in the Exchange, vacant. As
 with most of the church’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6369.68px;">founders, Frederick’s civic involvements extended beyond Westminster. He served on the Winnipeg </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6720.45px;">School Board from 1914 to 1930, and was Chairman for two years. He was a member
 of the board </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7071.21px;">for United College (a union of Manitoba and Wesley Colleges in 1938) and was an
 elder, trustee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7421.98px;">and charter member of Westminster United Church. He died unmarried in Winnipeg
 on July, 1947 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7772.74px;">and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery. In his will Frederick made a large bequest
 to the Winnipeg </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8123.51px;">Foundation. The Foundation honoured his gift by naming a street after him in its
 development </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8474.27px;">of the Alloway land that became Tuxedo and Charleswood.</span>
