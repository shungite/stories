        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">forum. This may have been where the idea was born, viz., to have one church
 board as the governing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">body of our congregation. Out of that idea we decided to have three groups meet—the executives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">the UCW, of Stewards, and of Session—together with staff. It is not possible to describe all that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">happened in that year of monthly meetings. But it soon became apparent how much
 overlapping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">there was: e.g., both the UCW and the stewards had finance and property
 committees; both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Session and the UCW had a mission committee and a flower committee, to give only
 a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">examples. As well, there were times when people had to report to both Stewards
 and Session, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">maybe, as well, to the Official Board. It was a clumsy and an inefficient type
 of organization. But, in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">setting up a new board structure, we had to make certain that all the work of
 the congregation would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">be covered, yet not duplicated. Also, we wanted to make certain that there would
 be a good mix of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">women, men, and young people on the board. We wanted to be certain, too, that
 there would be a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3826.01px;">time limit for any one person to serve.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">We began the discussion and study of a possible new structure of congregational
 government at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">beginning of 1969, and the final report was presented to the congregational
 meeting in January 1970. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">It was approved. The General Board (as we decided to call it) would be made up
 of nine committees, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">with four persons on each committee—worship, education, finance, property, communications, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">membership and visiting, fellowship, outreach, and nominations. There would also
 be a chairperson, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">vice chair, secretary, and treasurer, with the staff as ex officio members. Each
 board member would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">serve a four-year term, and the chair would change every second year. Each of
 the nine committees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">could add to their numbers for their own committee tasks, but all major
 decisions would be brought </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">to the monthly meeting of the General Board for final approval. This obviously
 is a very brief </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">description of a very major change in congregational government. (The text of
 the constitution is in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">my Westminster file.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">I have included this summary of our church board restructuring because it
 changed in a major way </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">the focus of my work at Westminster. It gave a whole new direction to the life
 and work of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">congregation. I was really impressed with the way in which a structure, or
 system of government, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">can change the life of a church. For many years, the congregation seemed to be
 pulled in three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">directions by the Session, by the UCW, and by the Stewards. Now, there was only
 one board. There </span>
