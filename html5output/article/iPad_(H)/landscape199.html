        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">A large Bible was kept on the pulpit which visitors and preachers signed. Names
 such as Dr. Grenfell  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">of Labrador, Ramsey MacDonald, former Prime Minister of Britain, Rev. Professor
 Moffat (translator of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">the Bible) and many others signed. Sad to relate vandal stole that historic
 Bible and it has never been </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">recovered.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Times and customs of dress change. On a hot Sunday in June, 1923, I was inducted
 as an elder.It was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">usual to wear a dark suit, tie, etc. and white shirt. My suited been to the
 cleaners and it reeked of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">gasoline. The new elder next to me kept sniffing during the ceremony. I was warm
 enough on that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">hot Sunday, but became more uncomfortable when the minister announced the title
 of his sermon; </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">he kept repeating it and seemed to look my way each time. The title of the
 sermon was ‘Christian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Fragrance.’</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">One event each year was the congregational picnic at the parks. One year we
 hired a C.N.R. four or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">five coach train, sold tickets all over Winnipeg and spent the Saturday
 afternoon at Victoria Beach. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">They gave me $200.00 to buy prizes and we spent it all. When the races started
 every person or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">stranger at Victoria Beach turned up to get in on the races and the grand prize
 list. Senator John T. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Haig acted as our policeman and saw to it that no-one took part unless they were
 connected with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">In the early twenties many of the large homes in the vicinity of Westminster
 were occupied by our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">members and their large families. The result was our Sunday School had a large
 attendance and at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">one time we had the largest Sunday School enrolment of any Presbyterian Church
 in Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">We had a boys’ department of around 150 boys between 12 and 17. This Department had been well </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">organized by the late Walter MacDonald and he had a powerful executive which met
 frequently on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">plans and projects — Colonel J.D. Sinclair, T.D. Patton, M. McCracken, B.V. Richardson, Wm. Bonellie,
 J. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">R. Major, and I was included as I was running the gym classes twice a week.  Class space was hard to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">find. Two classes in the kitchen, 6 or 7 on the gym floor (Lower Hall), one each
 in the hall, the men's </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">washroom, the vestry, and the  shower dressing room ( the latter usually erupted  in weekly disaster). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">Wm. Hurst was assistant on records and he usually caused an upset when coming in
 weeding </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">through the classes wearing a large racoon coat. Curriculum teachers’ book were poor and teachers </span>
