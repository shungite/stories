        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">R.D. (Bert) Macfarlane represents a significant portion of the congregation
 which has always been the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">back bone of a successful Church — dedicated volunteers; the tireless men and women who  run our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">programs and shoulder responsibilities for — among many reasons — the joy of serving. R.D. worked  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">in our Sunday School and our Athletic program for young people. He edited a
 newsletter for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">years. He also fathered a girl who became, like himself, a leader every bit as
 strong as her father; </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Bert can tell his own story. The Annual Meeting he alludes to in the beginning
 took place in 1972 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">during the Ministry of Reid Vipond, the same year this document was written …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:3173.72px;">“At the Annual Meeting of Westminster held in the Sanctuary this year Dr. Vipond
 was kind enough </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">to draw attention to the fact that I had completed 53 years of activity in this
 church and invited the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">congregation to give suitable recognition. I am deeply grateful to our minister
 for making this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">reference.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Fifty three years is a short period in life’s record and I have enjoyed every bit of it and am thankful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">that I had the opportunity of being associated with such fine people in serving
 the Master.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">When I arrived in Winnipeg in 1919 I made a habit of visiting various churches
 to determine what </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">part of the city I would live in.I dropped into Westminster one September
 evening and was delighted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">to find that a Boys' Conference was being held and the speaker was Mr. Taylor
 Staten. He is the man </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">who started Tuxis and Trail Rangers — a great friend of mine. He spotted me in the congregation and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">told the Conference the story of three lads from Calgary who came to the Lake of
 The Woods in 1910 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">to a Boys’ Conference. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">He related that two of them had given their lives in the First World War, and he
 had had a visit with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">the remaining one a few months earlier while lecturing to troops during the
 march of occupation in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">Germany; I had obtained leave and had travelled 20 kilometres to listen to my
 friend. Taylor Staten </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">then asked me to come up to the pulpit and say a few words. Although that was my
 introduction to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">Westminster, I really had the Westminster table pinned on me many years before I
 ever heard of this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">church.</span>
