        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">helped a good deal, especially in Rinke’s last years when his health was failing. They were succeeded </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">by Mr. and Mrs. Abe Thiessen, who in a year or two, became fed up with the
 sixty-eight steps to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">fourth floor, and moved into their own home nearby. They also pointed out how
 very little private life </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">they had by living in the building where they worked.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">In the church office, Mrs. Violet Ridd had been secretary for eight or ten years
 before our arrival. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">However, a few months into my tenure she suddenly resigned. Mrs. Anna Burt was
 hired to replace </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">her, and for many years she served the church with great efficiency. She had
 been a Scottish war </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">bride, coming to Canada shortly after the war to marry Phil whom she had met
 when they were both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">in the Armed Forces. They had two daughters, Margaret and Anne. Phil was an
 orderly at the Deer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Lodge Veterans Hospital. Mrs. Burt was extremely efficient, and in short order
 had the office routine </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">down to a science. She was with us till the late seventies, though her
 continuing problem with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">arthritis finally forced her to work from a wheelchair. They bought a van with a
 side-lift to assist in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">transporting her to the church until she reached retirement age. Her long-time
 dream was to tour </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Nova Scotia. (“I’ve toured all of old Scotland,” she used to say. “Now, if I could only see New </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">Scotland.”) The church’s farewell gift to her was airfare for her and Phil to Halifax, with a
 para-transit </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">van waiting for them to do a two-week tour in the Maritimes. Unfortunately, upon
 arrival back in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Winnipeg, she suffered a bout of pneumonia, and after being bed-ridden for a few
 weeks, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">arthritis became so severe she had to spend her remaining year and a half in
 bed. After her death, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">Phil began a life of travel, revisiting countries where he had served in WWII.
 He had been a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">patient, caring, and long-serving husband.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Pat Hodges arrived in Winnipeg with her husband, Houston, just as the search
 committee was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">looking for a new church secretary. Houston was a United  Methodist minister from Texas, and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">come to be the social action secretary of Winnipeg presbytery. Joan McConnell
 met the Hodges, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">discovered that Pat had been a church secretary in the deep south and was hoping
 to get </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">employment in Winnipeg. It was a perfect fit, and for our last two years at
 Westminster, the phone </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">was answered with a happy and cheery southern drawl.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">For many years, indeed, from its beginning in 1892, Westminster had a Session
 and a Deacon’s Court. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">The Deacon’s Court was something like an official board in that it consisted of all members
