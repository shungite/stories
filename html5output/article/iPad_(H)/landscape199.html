        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2511.27px;">R.D. (Bert) Macfarlane represents a significant portion of the congregation
 which has always been the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2862.03px;">back bone of a successful Church — dedicated volunteers; the tireless men and women who  run our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3212.80px;">programs and shoulder responsibilities for — among many reasons — the joy of serving. R.D. worked  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3563.56px;">in our Sunday School and our Athletic program for young people. He edited a
 newsletter for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3914.33px;">years. He also fathered a girl who became, like himself, a leader every bit as
 strong as her father; </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4815.86px;">Bert can tell his own story. The Annual Meeting he alludes to in the beginning
 took place in 1972 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5166.62px;">during the Ministry of Reid Vipond, the same year this document was written …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:5717.39px;">“At the Annual Meeting of Westminster held in the Sanctuary this year Dr. Vipond
 was kind enough </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6068.15px;">to draw attention to the fact that I had completed 53 years of activity in this
 church and invited the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6418.92px;">congregation to give suitable recognition. I am deeply grateful to our minister
 for making this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6769.68px;">reference.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7320.45px;">Fifty three years is a short period in life’s record and I have enjoyed every bit of it and am thankful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7671.21px;">that I had the opportunity of being associated with such fine people in serving
 the Master.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8221.98px;">When I arrived in Winnipeg in 1919 I made a habit of visiting various churches
 to determine what </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">part of the city I would live in.I dropped into Westminster one September
 evening and was delighted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">to find that a Boys' Conference was being held and the speaker was Mr. Taylor
 Staten. He is the man </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9274.27px;">who started Tuxis and Trail Rangers — a great friend of mine. He spotted me in the congregation and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9625.04px;">told the Conference the story of three lads from Calgary who came to the Lake of
 The Woods in 1910 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9975.80px;">to a Boys’ Conference. </span>
