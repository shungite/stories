        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Education in the early days of NFLD was very basic. The local school was (and
 still is) owned and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">operated by the church, whatever denomination of “Church” was to be found in each outpost be it </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, or later, Salvation Army Outpost
 settlements were normally all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">people- one denomination. To be sure that the local school reflected the values
 of the local church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">the minister of the community’s church was Chair of the Board. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Ernest remarks how, at age 18, working in his first pastoral charge as a
 probationer ( a student </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">minister in charge of a community church) in the remote village of Burgeo, he
 became the instant </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Chairman of the School Board. His mother gave him her most precious possession,
 an Unabridged </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Webster Dictionary to help in this aspect of his work. Education in outpost
 schools was basic and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">quality of teaching varied from outpost to outpost.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">He mentions, with considerable pride that despite the”leanness” of the basic education system five of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">the Howse family of six children earned University degrees and the sixth became
 an R.N. an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">incredible accomplishment. One of his siblings became a missionary in Angola,
 another a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">Government Geologist, another a Marine Biologist, himself an ordained minister.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">As mentioned, Ernest’s father, Charles, was originally a fisherman; at age 19 he was a skipper of his
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">own boat and by faith an Anglican but at age 22 his life changed completely.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">Attending a Methodist Revival, Charles made a personal decision to become a
 Methodist.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">He left fishing and, with his brothers’ support, went to St. John’s to the Methodist College ( what we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">would call high school) and received his A.A. Diploma, Associate of Arts. This
 diploma would be </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">accepted by Canadian universities as qualified entrance education. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8182.89px;">Having no money to attend university Charles worked for several years as a
 school teacher. When he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8533.66px;">had raised the requisite money he left NFLD, and attended Mt. Allison University
 in N.B, and then, on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">to Garret Biblical Institute in Chicago. After graduation he returned to NFLD
 where he lived out his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">life as a minister. </span>
