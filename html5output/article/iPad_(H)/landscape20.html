        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="left:3660.00px;">MINNIE JULIA BEATRICE CAMPBELL, COMMUNITY ACTIVIST</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:599.60px;">By the end of her life, Minnie was lauded not only as one of Canada’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:950.36px;">foremost reformists, but also as one of Canada’s best-known women. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:1301.13px;">Through her charitable activities over five decades she worked to provide </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:1651.89px;">lodging, food, and medical care to Winnipeg’s poor and sick, and promoted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:2002.66px;">the active participation of women in public life, if largely by example (she </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:2353.42px;">was decidedly not a suffragette, and said so publically). Her activism, like </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3660.00px;top:2704.19px;">that of many of her reform-minded peers, was animated by more than a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3054.95px;">little imperialist sentiment. Biographical accounts depict Minnie as inclined to
 see the poverty and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:3405.71px;">“coarseness” that she encountered in the grubby frontier-town of Winnipeg as emanating from
 the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3756.48px;">personal failings of its inhabitants, and she never hesitated to preach
 Christianity as a path not only </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4107.24px;">to spiritual redemption, but also to civility and social betterment. Giving
 energetic voice to a view </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4458.01px;">shared with growing complacency by many of the Anglo-Protestants elites of her
 day, Minnie firmly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4808.77px;">associated the spread of civilization with the spread of Christian culture. As a
 privileged member of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5159.54px;">this culture living in a rugged, religiously pluralist environment, she further
 believed it her duty to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5510.30px;">serve as its ambassador. The nature of many her charitable activities — organizing essay contests </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5861.07px;">about important colonizers, introducing “moral instruction” as a component of the Winnipeg General </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6211.83px;">Hospital’s care for its indigent patients, delivering presentations promoting the Empire
 and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6562.60px;">civilized standards of behaviour with which it was associated — reflects that conviction; as did her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6913.36px;">penchant for speaking in an affected English accent and holding balls that
 imitated the styles of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7264.13px;">imperial capital.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7814.89px;">Back to Minnie: born in Palermo, Ontario, in June 1862, she was the daughter of
 Dr. Anson Buck and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8165.66px;">Keturah Adelaide Howell, both descendants of United Empire Loyalists. Buck was
 proud of his loyalist </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8516.42px;">heritage, as he was of his connection to leading reformers in England. Minnie’s upbringing was rather </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8867.19px;">liberal by the contemporary standards: she claims that her father was of a “progressive mindset”, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9217.95px;">firmly believing that “boys could do anything girls could.” All the same, Minnie was not sent to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9568.72px;">prestigious professional schools of the University of Toronto, but rather to
 Wesleyan Female College, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9919.48px;">where she studied mathematics, classics, science, art and music. Her education
 may therefore have </span>
