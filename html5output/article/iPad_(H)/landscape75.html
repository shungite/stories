        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Graduating from Pine Hill in 1922 Bonnell’s first charge was on PEI where he served at New Glasgow </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Presbyterian Church. In 1923 he was called to St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church in St. John, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">New Brunswick. In 1927 he completed his Bachelor of Divinity Degree and was
 given a one year leave</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">of absence from St. Andrew’s in order to take post-graduate studies in London, England. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">During that time he travelled extensively on the continent. This was probably
 when he first visited </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Russia becoming familiar with the Bolsheviks’ campaign to turn the country away from religion.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">He later returned to this issue in 1934 when he again toured Europe with Rev.
 Sherwood Eddy. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">He preached sermons at both Westminster United and at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
 in New York </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">about the experience. In his New York sermons he warned Americans about the
 possibility of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Communists’ infiltrating American institutions and attempting to foster atheism in the U.S.
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">These sermons were regularly reported in the New York papers each week.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">It seems that Bonnell was adding his voice to others in developing America’s paranoia concerning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">Communism; this paranoia resulted in the McCarthy Hearings in the 1950s.
 Ironically, Bonnell’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">name was on a list of suspects of one of McCarthy’s aides. When Bonnell and two other leaders </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">of The National Conference of Christians and Jews found that McCarthy was
 targeting them they </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">sent a public telegram to President Eisenhower protesting accusations that
 Protestant clergymen </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">in the U.S. were a major source of supporters for “the Communist apparatus.” Eisenhower replied </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">in support for the clergy. His statement marked a turn from indulgence to
 opposition </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">in the Eisenhower Administration’s attitude toward the Senator from Wisconsin.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">In any event, in 1928 when he returned from his studies in England to St. John,
 New Brunswick </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">and before leaving for Winnipeg, Bonnell was given a public commendation by the
 City for his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">preaching and for his contribution to St. John. In 1929 he received his call to
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">and was inducted into the pastorate here in October of that year.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-19" style="top:8867.59px;">Part Two: Bonnell’s Time At Westminster</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9419.19px;">When I joined Westminster Choir in 1951, Bonnell had been gone from here for 16
 years. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9769.95px;">Nevertheless his name still invoked a kind of awe. In part this awe was inspired
 by his leaving </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10120.72px;">here for New York. And to a major church, Fifth Avenue Presbyterian, as well. In
 part I also heard </span>
