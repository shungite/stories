        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Unit 10, too, is still going strong, celebrating their 50 year mark as a unit
 within the church, Phyllis </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Reader reports. They are going to the Temple Gardens Spa in Moose Jaw to
 celebrate this auspicious </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">occasion at the end of the month! Unit 10 meets once a month during the winter
 months and has a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">special dinner at Christmas and spring. Liz Witjkamp, Rita Menzies, Val
 McIntyre, Lynn Heise and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Ann Peeler have been members since the beginning. Phyllis goes on to say the
 group “was a great </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">support, as members went through the various stages of life, career changes,
 raising kids, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">grandchildren, weddings, funerals and parents passing away. We did our share of
 teas and helping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">with after church luncheons, garage sales, and contributions of home baking for
 a host of events. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">We've been through it all and have developed very strong, loyal relationships
 over the years. We met </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">in members homes once a month. Discussed church business and all of us have
 served on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">various committees and the church board. In fact they are now recycling us
 again.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">Women were part of many activities of the Church, singing in the Choir, teaching
 Sunday School and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">leading youth groups, such as Canadian Girls in Training. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">One of the groups of women that has continued over most of Westminster’s 125 years is the Sewing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Circle, becoming the Quilting Group, and more recently, including a knitting
 group. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Through many decades this group provided hundreds of quilts, layettes, afghans,
 knitted hats, mitts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">and scarves to those in need, all over the world. For example, in 1937, 25
 quilts given to the needy, in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">1942, 26quilts and 48 warm garments shipped overseas and another 6 quilts sent
 to fresh air camps. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">In 1943, 30 quilts and afghans sent to the Red Cross to be part of their victory
 bundles and 19 layettes </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">and many knitted garments were distributed in Winnipeg. Westminster women sent
 their crafted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">items to Europe, Korea, Angola, and to small Northern communities in norther
 Manitoba, and locally </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">to the Xmas cheer board, Stella Ave Mission and as close to home as Mulvey
 School. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Recently, knitting became the activity of choice for many volunteers, working at
 home and in church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">They have continued to produce mitts, scarves etc. for the Christmas season
 mitten tree. Another </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">group of knitters was formed in 2005 to produce prayer shawls.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">A few historic names have been recorded of the women taking part in this
 activity over the years. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">One person, Mrs. James McKenzie set a record in 1966 when she turned in 39 pairs
 of men’s socks — </span>
