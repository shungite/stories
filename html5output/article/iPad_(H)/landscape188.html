        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Westminster Riddell family, so for them it was like coming home. Bill was with
 us until my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">retirement in 1979. Joan McConnell went with Barry to Britain for a year’s sabbatical in 1978, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Elaine Hickerson, wife of Rev. Bill Hickerson, secretary of Manitoba conference,
 came as her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">replacement. Audrey McLennan also left in 1978 to work full- time at her home
 church, Fort Garry, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">and Orma Backhouse replaced her. Partly as a footnote, and as a point of
 interest, Joan McConnell is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">now personnel secretary of Manitoba conference. Audrey McLennan later became
 president of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">Manitoba conference, and now chairs the department at head office that produces </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:11387.30px;top:2072.19px;">Spirit Connection</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:13542.27px;top:2072.19px;"> on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">Vision TV.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">The music department saw fewer changes than any other part of the staff. Herb
 Sadler was organist </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">and choir director from 1919–1953. Glen Harrison then assumed the position of choir director—and is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">still there! Barry Anderson was organist for several years, and was succeeded in
 1967 by Don </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">Menzies, who is also still in that position. With a fine, four-manual Casavant
 organ, and excellent </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">organists and choir directors, Westminster has had superlative music throughout
 its long history. In </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">our years, Glen Harrison directed many special choir recitals, and on numerous
 occasions had a half </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">dozen Winnipeg Symphony players for orchestral accompaniment. Don Menzies, as
 well as guest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">organists, have played (and broadcast) many recitals. I have heard both Marcel
 Dupré and E. Power </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Biggs in recital on that outstanding instrument.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">Writing this much about staff, I’ll also add a word here about our custodians. When we were first at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">Westminster, Mr. Jake Flipse looked after the church. A native of Holland, he
 had worked with a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">landscape gardening company when he first came to Canada. I’m not sure when he came to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">church, but Mr. and Mrs. Flipse occupied the three-room apartment on the fourth
 floor of the church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">hall for many years. Mr. Flipse was quiet, unassuming, very kind, very
 efficient, and, of course, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">extremely capable in terms of the church lawn. His hours were long; he was
 literally on call anytime, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">all the time, from when the doors opened in the morning until the last meeting
 was over at night. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">had Monday evening and all day Tuesday off. His replacement for those times was
 old Mr. Fish. I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">glad he was there, because it made possible my little joke: ours was the only
 church in town that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">employed Fish and Flipse!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">Upon returning to Westminster in 1963, we still had a Dutch custodian, Rinke
 Zielstra. Mrs. Zielstra </span>
