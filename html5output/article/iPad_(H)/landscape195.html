        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">1)Early in 1998 a sub-committee was created from our Outreach Committee with the
 mandate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">looking into refugee sponsorships. In the spring of 1998 I met with Despic
 Mladen and his wife at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">church. After discussion it was decided the church would look at sponsoring his
 cousin, Lela Saric </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">and her family to Winnipeg. Lela had a husband and 3 daughters. They were
 trapped in Sarajevo, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Yugoslavia during the civil war in that country.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">After discussion with the Outreach Committee and the Board of the Church a
 motion was put forth to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">sponsor this family. A letter was sent the United Church head office in Toronto.
 On April 21, 1998 a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Letter of Approval was received from the United Church. It was forwarded to
 Immigration Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">On Sept. 3, 1999 a letter was received from Citizenship and Immigration that
 they had been approved </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">and would be arriving in Winnipeg on Sept.21, 1999. This was a happy day. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Lela, her husband, Zeljko and daughters, Violeta, Jovana and Danijela arrived
 safely and were greeted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">with family members.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">With Betty Halsteadâ€™s efforts of fund raising we raised over $10,000.00. There was a lot of interest
 and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">support from the congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">This family has remained in Winnipeg and became employed with all the girls
 receiving their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">education here in the city. This was a successful sponsorship.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6579.83px;">2) I received a letter in the church office on April 2, 2000 from an Allahyar
 Raza. I interviewed him </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">and his request from the church was to sponsor his brother, Khalil Raza who was
 a teenager trapped </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">in Moscow, Russia. He had been separated from his family during the Afghanistan
 war. Allahyar was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">prepared to support his brother financially, emotionally and culturally. He
 wanted the documentation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">done by Westminster United Church as Immigration Canada would not accept his
 application as he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">was a student at University of Winnipeg. The Outreach Committee and the Board of
 the Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">accepted this application and it went through the process with Immigration
 Canada. Due to the 9/11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">attacks in New York City in 2001 there were numerous delays. On Sept. 29th, 2003
 Khalil Raza arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">at the Winnipeg airport to the absolute joy of his brother, Allahyar. The church
 gave him $500.00 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">clothing and some miscellaneous items to get started. He quickly became employed
 and excelled in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">his new home. He is married and now lives in Vancouver, B.C. Again a very
 successful sponsorship.</span>
