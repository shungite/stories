        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">When Lorraine and Betty arrived in Oradea, they discovered that, in fact, caring
 for babies under 2 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">years of age, was a new undertaking for the Foundation, and much of the two
 months they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">there, was spent orienting the Romanian workers to this new undertaking. They
 worked on a floor of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">the children’s hospital in Oradea which housed babies up to the age of two years. The great
 majority </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">of these babies had been born to Roma (gypsy) parents. The Roma custom is for
 the women to marry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">very young, and so they have large families, born into extreme poverty. The work
 of the foundation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">was to help the babies develop socially and physically so that they were healthy
 in more than a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">medical sense, as they moved back home, or into foster homes, and they had some
 degree of success. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Dwight did distance work for a computer software development firm in Washington
 State, and 80% of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">his salary went to pay Romanians who worked for the foundation. When Lorraine
 and her friend </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Betty returned to Canada, one of their goals was to raise enough money to
 supplement Dwight’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">salary, so that the work they were doing as volunteers, could be taken over by
 Romanian workers. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">Churches, service clubs, and individuals in our area helped them largely reach
 that goal. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">In 2006, Lorraine went back to her babies in Romania. She spent over a month
 there in May — this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">time alone — but she was really happy to see the unbelievable difference that one year had
 made in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">the reactions of the babies. She said that she would never had thought of
 adopting any of the babies </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">she saw the previous year, because they would all have psychological problems
 resulting from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">neglect. But in one year, the fact that babies were being held to be fed,
 cuddled and played with, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">meant that they seemed like normal healthy children who would grow up with a
 future! She also </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">marvelled at the difference in the hospital personnel. The results of this
 program that they had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">witnessed, greatly influenced their attitudes, so that they started treating the
 babies as people, rather </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">than seeing the hospital as a warehouse to shelter them. Finally, Lorraine was
 also pleased to see </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">how the money which had been collected here in the Okanagan was providing
 salaries for good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">Romanian workers who were making all the difference to the work there. Dwight
 said that they had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">become one of the Foundation’s most important sources of funding!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Of course, Lorraine was talking about going back to Oradea again, and this time,
 Bob was going to go </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">with her. Plans had not been set, but the talk was of doing a vacation trip
 around eastern Europe </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">when the volunteer work was done. Unfortunately, Lorraine’s death in 2008 put an end to that </span>
