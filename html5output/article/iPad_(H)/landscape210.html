        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">if it is only five blocks away. And, second, we certainly didn’t realize at the time how extremely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">fortunate we were to have purchased our home when we did. We bought 718 Waterloo
 in 1971 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">$23,900, and, exactly ten years later, sold it for $67,000. What a boon to have
 cash in hand to buy our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">retirement home in London, a much better home in every way, and almost
 completely paid for by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">sale of 718 Waterloo.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">There were at least two important decisions regarding property and finances made
 by the trustees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">and board at Westminster in our time there. First, the old manse at 120 Maryland
 Street was being </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">used by Manitoba conference as the office for the conference staff and the
 resource centre. (141 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Waterloo had been bought as a manse in about 1958.) After fairly lengthy
 negotiations with the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">conference executive, Westminster agreed to tear down the old manse and build a
 two-storey office </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">building to serve the conference needs. This was accomplished in 1964. The
 conference rent is used </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">to pay off the $80,000 mortgage on the office building, so it has been a win-win
 situation for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:4376.77px;">church. The mortgage is just about paid off at this point (1992), and from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:4727.54px;">now on, the conference rental will become church income for Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:5278.30px;">Second, about 1965 I suggested that we should set up a foundation fund </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:5629.07px;">for the church. There were always people asking if there was some </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:5979.83px;">particular need toward which a memorial contribution could be made. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:6330.60px;">Also, there were three or four small trust funds (not more than a total of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:6681.36px;">$10,000–$15,000) and they were carried along year after year, reported at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:7032.13px;">the annual meeting, but never used. No one quite knew what to do with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:7382.89px;">them. It was my feeling that if there were a Foundation Fund properly set </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:7733.66px;">up and publicized, there would be contributions made to it. Perhaps some </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:8084.42px;">people might put it into their wills. I knew that other churches had such a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:8435.19px;">fund, including Knox in Winnipeg which had the Duval Foundation, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">named for its first minister.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">After much discussion, the idea got off the ground. A constitution was drawn up.
 It went through the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">proper channels in the provincial government so that it was legally chartered.
