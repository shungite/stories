        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">At only 14, he joined the Canadian Militia as a bugler and six years later, in
 1870, was promoted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">to the rank of Corporal. His first assignment was to guard the Welland Canal at
 Carlton, Ontario </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">against the Fenian Raids (1866-70). While ultimately no attack in this
 insurrection was made against </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">the post where he stationed, his early military career was eventful in other
 ways. In the militia, he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">met Colonel George A. French, just as the colonel was preparing to head the
 newly established North </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">West Mounted Police (NWMP). At 21, James enlisted in that force, with the rank
 of Staff Constable, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">and remained there until 1877. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">While, for the majority of us, the most involved role we play in relation to
 history is of bystander, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">for a moment during his time with the NWMP James transcended this station — although only, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">as it were, by serving as a witness: James was present at the Fort Carleton
 negotiations between </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">the Crown, represented by Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris, and the Wood and
 Plain Cree </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">Indians, and his name is among those witnesses whose signature authenticated the
 fateful treaty </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">resulting from these negotiations. When he returned in 1878 to civilian life,
 still only in his mid-20s, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">it was to Winnipeg. Young though the city was, it was by then the fastest
 growing settlement west </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">of Ontario, so there was strong demand for able-bodied men in construction jobs.
 James settled </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">in the Point Douglas area to work as a carpenter. For all his early adventures,
 the circumstances </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">of his formative years were thus humbler, socially speaking, than many of his
 fellow founders </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">of Westminster. At any rate, it was as a carpenter that James developed some of
 the practical skills </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">crucial to his later, more distinguished career as an architect. His election to
 the Winnipeg School </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">Board effectively ended his carpentry days, and offered a springboard for his
 promotion a few years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">later to Architect &amp; Commissioner of School Buildings, a post he held for the next thirty-six years.
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:7533.66px;">The first schools he designed were all three-story structures, whose </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:7884.42px;">Victorian influence is obvious; similarly styled schools constructed in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:8235.19px;">that era can be found all over England. This is also true of t</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:8585.95px;">he two-story schools he later designed. Sadly, many of these buildings </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:8936.72px;">have been torn down for one reason or another, but those that remain </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4104.03px;top:9287.48px;">— La Vérandrye on Lilac Street, Earl Grey on Cockburn, and Laura </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:9638.25px;">Secord School (pictured) on Wolseley, among them — are pleasing relics </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:9989.01px;">that add character and a dash, but not more than a dash, of grandeur </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4160.03px;top:10339.78px;">to their surrounding neighbourhoods. </span>
