        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">glass windows were cleaned and re-leaded using interest from the Foundation
 Fund. By the time of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">my retirement in 1979, the foundation stood at well over $100,000. The 1991
 Annual Report shows </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">$300,000. Capital grants have been given to put a new roof on the church and to
 renew the heating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">system. I understand that interest from the fund is being used to underwrite
 some of the expenses of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">the 1992 centennial year observances. Perhaps our airfare to the centennial is
 being paid from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">interest on the fund which I so strongly urged the board to establish!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">I should mention, too, establishing the chapel. In both Edmonton and Regina,
 there was a separate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">chapel, so useful when you have a large sanctuary. Many smaller wedding and
 funeral services were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">conducted in the chapel. But there simply didn’t seem to be any suitable location for such a facility at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Westminster, unless we used either the church parlour, always called the Ladies
 Parlour, or the so-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">called primary room which was a multi-purpose room used for Sunday school, the
 library, counting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">offering on Sunday, quilting every Thursday, and for various committee meetings.
 After some tactful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">discussion with the UCW, it was planned to use the parlour. We would have chairs
 instead of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">permanent pews. There would be a drape (on a track) behind the communion table
 and lectern and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">organ that could be pulled around to the front of the chancel area to make the
 chapel a meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">room, and all would be well. A young architect with a good sense of what we
 desired did our design </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">work. Sufficient families gave memorial contributions to cover the $18,000 cost;
 and Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">now has a most attractive chapel which seats sixty or seventy people. By
 interesting coincidence, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">first of many funerals I conducted in the chapel was that young architect’s aunt (one of the Riddell </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">family). The second funeral was for the mother of Ted Millman, chairman of the
 chapel building </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">committee. There have been many weddings, including Doug and Jane’s on August 25, 1972. We have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">had Sunday school teachers’ communion services. Many groups use it for at least the devotional part </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">of their meeting. And on only one occasion that I know of did we pull the
 reredos drape to turn the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8235.19px;">chapel into an ordinary meeting room!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">Before we came to Westminster, there had been much discussion about
 discontinuing the Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">evening service. Attendance was often as low as twenty-five or thirty people,
 compared to the five to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">seven hundred at 11 a.m. But there was the usual reluctance in the Session to
 take such a step </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">despite the low attendance and the fact that only a couple of elders ever
 attended. Also, as Dr. </span>
