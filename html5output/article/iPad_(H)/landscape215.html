        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Then, under the Day Care Act , 1986 , it was operated with a Board of Directors,
 a formal budget a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Director and Staff under a set of rules and regulations.  Church people were still involved both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">creating lunches and snacks, and with volunteers meeting the kids from school to
 lunch at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">church and back again and again at close of school day. Volunteers also sat with
 them and chatted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">during lunch hours. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">In 1995 it was incorporated as a Government agency. The Centre can handle 50
 children. Twelve </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">spaces are reserved for children ages 4 and 5. They come to the Centre before
 school (nursery and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Kindergarten)  in the morning, have breakfast and are then taken to school by staff. They are
 then </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">picked up by stafff at 11:30, returned to the Centre and given lunch. They then
 stay at the Centre till </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">they are picked up by their parents after work.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">There are 38 spaces for children ages 6 to 12. They have the same regimen
 morning and noon but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">return to school for the afternoon. Then they are picked up at the end of school
 day and returned to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">the Centre where they are picked up by their parents.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">As a government agency  the Centre now operates full time (during school holidays and summer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">vacation). According to staff the numbers of children attending varies during
 these "holiday" times </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">but generally maintains the same level of attendance all year. There are no more
 volunteers and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">therefore no more direct participation of the Westminster congregation in the
 operation. The total </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">paid staff under Director Greg Blanco, is trained and professional.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">The  Staff sets a monthly meal plan (based on Canada food guide), does the shopping
 for groceries, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">and prepares and serves breakfast, lunch and after school snacks. The cost of
 the food program is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">approximately $13,000/annum . Food is prepared i the Church's basement kitchen
 and the children </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">eat in the area we know as our gymnasium.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">The program offered to the children is Government stipulated; "Children should
 learn through play" </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">at the Centre. Learning through play is an age-old concept but sometimes
 misunderstood; we often </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">believe that play is play but learning is work.  However, public school, kindergarten and nursery </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">school teachers will tell you how directed experience in the child’s environment can still be play and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">yet have structure and purpose. The Staff of the Centre  is challenged as much as classroom teachers </span>
