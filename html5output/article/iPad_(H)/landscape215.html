        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">an alternative to the service in the sanctuary. We began with a Sunday evening
 discussion group in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">the lecture hall. We had a speaker, followed by small groups, followed by tea
 and cookies.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">That went well for a year or so. Then, we tried monthly meetings. But, before
 too long, we gave up on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">any regular Sunday evening gatherings, leaving ourselves open for “special events” as the need arose. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Strangely enough, there were very few special events, not even at anniversary
 time. The Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">evening services actually passed away peacefully! We didn’t even conduct a memorial service for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">them.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Westminster has always been a congregation that has reached out to the
 community. Stories abound </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">of the hundreds of servicemen during World War I who used the spacious gym and
 church hall for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">recreational purposes. Indeed, at one point in those early years, they had a
 pool table in one of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">basement rooms, much to the disgust of the Wednesday evening prayer meeting
 group who prayed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">fervently that “this wicked thing would soon be removed from our premises.” That prayer must have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">been answered, because when the pool table was worn out, it was never replaced.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">Shortly after we arrived in 1963, there were discussions about some kind of
 church-sponsored child </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">care on a permanent basis. As early as 1948 or 1949, there had been a weekday
 play school that our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">two-year-old Francie (as the minister’s child) was allowed to attend, though the lower age limit was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">three. But, by 1965, with the active assistance of Mrs. Gretta Brown (daughter
 of the late Charles W. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">Gordon—“Ralph Connor”), we looked at the possibility of a lunch and after- school program for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">kindergarten to Grade 3 boys and girls of nearby Mulvey School who were children
 of sole-support </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">working mothers. After a year of planning, getting the program officially
 recognized by the provincial </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">government, and with funding in place by the church, the government and the
 mothers, the project </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">began. Major funding was eventually picked up by the government, with the church
 supplying all the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">facilities and the volunteers. We began with one staff person and twenty-five or
 so children. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">program has grown, and for many years has had two workers and forty to fifty
 children. A large </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">group of volunteers assist at meal time. All equipment has been upgraded to
 fulfill the Board of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Health requirements. Members of the congregation carry most of the
 responsibility for the work of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">the child care board. It is such a well-established program that one couldn’t imagine Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">without it.</span>
