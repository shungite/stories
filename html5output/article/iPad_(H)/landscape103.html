 when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">he pulled the chain. “The deluge that came down would almost outdo Niagara. The first time </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">I performed the operation I thought that I had burst a water main.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:1219.89px;">While at the college he considered what he might want as his next </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:1570.66px;">step in life: lawyer, teacher? As a lawyer he might become the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:1921.42px;">Premier of NFLD or even the Prime Minister of Canada. Nfld had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:2272.19px;">just taken Canada into confederation. (Most Canadians probably </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:2622.95px;">thought that we had taken NFLD into confederation. Newfies saw it </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:2973.72px;">the other way round.) That next step however would require money </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:3324.48px;">he didn’t yet have.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:3875.25px;">At the end of his year at college Ernest returned home. By this time </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:4226.01px;">his parents were living in Grand Banks, NFLD. Grand Backs was a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:4576.77px;">centre for shipping fish and other cargo to Spain and the Caribbean. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:4927.54px;">During the summer following his return he worked at jobs in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4680.00px;top:5278.30px;">harbour including filling ships with foul smelling fish — what his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">fellow workers called “lungering up.” The money was good (75¢ an hour) and he was on his way to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">establishing his university fund.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">However, at the end of summer Ernest decided to further his fund through
 teaching. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">He was 17 years old.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">He applied to the Methodist Superintendent of Schools to get a teaching position
 in Labrador. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">None was available but a call came for a senior master (upper grades) at La
 Scie, an outport on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Northern coast of the island, for which he would earn $1000 for the 10 month
 school year. He took </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">the job. As Master of the Upper Grades he became a person of consequence in the
 small town. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">He also made friends with the Methodist minister who was, of course, his ‘employer.’ </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">The minister, Max Parsons, was himself only a Probationer ( a
 minister-in-training). </span>
