 the death toll from </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Moslem rebellion, with the massacres’ toll reaching 200,000 … Then Leslie gets down to work and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">switches to good news; the Club’s beginning.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Two men in the congregation, James Crowe (see the article on our founders) and
 Stanley Jones (see </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">the article on The Actimist Club) called together 12 young men on September 25th
 and proposed the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">formation of a Young Men’s Club. Two weeks later the Club was formed with Matt Tennent as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">President. Matt was soon transferred down East and was replaced by Eddie Grant.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Leslie goes on to recount the Club’s activities: to the little settlement of Cormorant, on the Hudson </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Bay Railway went a bundle of Christmas cheer, gladdening the hearts of 22
 children. From the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">perspective of the 21st Century we picture a group of children spread out on the
 floor stone drunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">from all that “Christmas cheer.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">During the 4th season from the public platform over 50 addresses (speeeches)
 were given to outside </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">organizations and a program of service was launched to country churches. The
 club also held an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:5829.07px;">‘undenominational’ mass meeting in April to 4000 people.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">In 1933 the club, with the help of the YMCA organized “two memorable mass meetings, the principal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">speaker being Dr. Sherwood Eddy. (This event is mentioned in the article on Dr.
 Bonnell.) Leslie </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">indicates that over 6000 people attended. Here, the writer has to recognize that
 Leslie Hunt was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">strong on hyperbole but short on simple honest mathematics. In two meetings he
 would have us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">believe that over 6000 people (seated in Westminster's sanctuary and in the
 Tivoli Theatre across the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Street) attended this momentous event. I don't believe it. Too many people and
 not enough space!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">In the event the club thrived till well into the 40s when WWII called away young
 men for service </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">overseas.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">This picture of the Club’s 1934 executive includes a number of names of people who became </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">prominent in Winnipeg in later years. Two names that immediately spring to mind
 are Gurzon </span>
