 mitten tree. Another </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">group of knitters was formed in 2005 to produce prayer shawls.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Few historic names have been recorded of the women taking part in this activity
 over the years. One </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">person, Mrs. James McKenzie set a record in 1966 when she turned in 39 pairs of
 men’s socks­  — at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">the age of 99. Another, Mrs. Dorothy Russell was the leader of the group in 1990
 but had been a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">quilter since 1955, a service record of 35 years. Names of participants which
 might resonate with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">some Westminster families to this day were Ruby Storey, Emma McIvor, Eleanor
 Connolly, Alma </span>

        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:3514.73px;">OVERVIEW OF REFUGEE SPONSORSHIPS </span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:3874.73px;">IN WESTMINSTER UNITED CHURCH</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4474.33px;">1)Early in 1998 a sub-committee was created from our Outreach Committee with the
 mandate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4825.09px;">looking into refugee sponsorships. In the spring of 1998 I met with Despic
 Mladen and his wife at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5175.86px;">church. After discussion it was decided the church would look at sponsoring his
 cousin, Lela Saric </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5526.62px;">and her family to Winnipeg. Lela had a husband and 3 daughters. They were
 trapped in Sarajevo, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5877.39px;">Yugoslavia during the civil war in that country.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6428.15px;">After discussion with the Outreach Committee and the Board of the Church a
 motion was put forth to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6778.92px;">sponsor this family. A letter was sent the United Church head office in Toronto.
 On April 21, 1998 a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7129.68px;">Letter of Approval was received from the United Church. It was forwarded to
 Immigration Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7480.45px;">On Sept. 3, 1999 a letter was received from Citizenship and Immigration that
 they had been approved </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7831.21px;">and would be arriving in Winnipeg on Sept.21, 1999. This was a happy day. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8381.98px;">Lela, her husband, Zeljko and daughters, Violeta, Jovana and Danijela arrived
 safely and were greeted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8732.74px;">with family members.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9283.50px;">With Betty Halstead’s efforts of fund raising we raised over $10,000.00. There was a lot of interest
 and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9634.27px;">support from the congregation.</span>
