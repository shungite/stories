        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">was the chair of the Fellowship committee for many years. People described
 Bonnie as considerate, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">elegant, caring and friendly – and as Georgine says, Westminster was part of her life. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">There are many in our recent history that have been in the forefront of
 leadership in Westminster — </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">we continue to remember Betty Halstead and her support of Refugees. There is
 record by a refugee of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Betty’s work — “Betty Halstead was in the heart of our efforts. Hers were the most difficult
 tasks, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">she did them with great joy and enthusiasm. Betty was a true leader, with always
 positive approach, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">giving encouragement when needed, taking initiative when needed, breaking
 through cultural </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">differences when needed.” There is also a choral scholarship in Betty’s name here at Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">And the work of Phyllis Reader and International Hope. Phyllis has worked
 tirelessly to collect and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">distribute surplus medical supplies to developing countries from Manitoba
 sources.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">And Christine McKee who Tom Carter, former Institute of Urban Studies
 (University of Winnipeg) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">Director and Canada Research Chair in Urban Change &amp; Adaptation, shared his admiration for McKee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">by way of written message. “Christine understood cities and she was a strong advocate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">comprehensive planning and revitalization of the inner city. She was also a very
 strong advocate for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">the more marginalized in society. Her tireless work for better quality of life
 for those in the inner city </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">was part of her strong commitment to planning equity.” She was an impetus for the Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">Housing Foundation and the work that continues today to provide adequate housing
 for families in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">the area around this church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Another to mention, was Lorraine Sweatman. She and Alan were frequent attendees
 of the Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">church Service, and Dick and I regularly shared comments with them about the
 sermon. She served </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">on many committees and was chair of the board. I found this note, actually in
 Isabel Auld’s papers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">acknowledging the work she had done organizing a fellowship and fashion, in
 1988, which generated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">almost $1,000.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">Isabel Auld, is another member to highlight and acknowledge her contribution to
 the Church and to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">the community. She died in March 2016 She served as chair of the Board of
 Westminster, and was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">active on many committees and belonged to a Circle. Yet, somehow, she managed to
 have a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">active community life, enriching the life of so many in this city. Her faith led
 her to many other ways </span>
