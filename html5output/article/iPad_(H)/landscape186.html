        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:1760.91px;">MEMBERSHIP DROPS IN CHURCH WOMEN</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2360.50px;">The consensus of United Church Women congregational presidents is that “membership is dropping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2711.27px;">drastically” chiefly  due to the working woman and lack of interest, retiring presbyterial president, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3062.03px;">Mrs. C.S. Barker reported Wednesday.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3612.80px;">The problem of poor response and lack of interest within individual churches was
 mentioned in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3963.56px;">several other reports given at the presbyterial's sixth annual meeting in Young
 United Church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4314.33px;">Membership last year was 5230. Figures for the previous year were not available …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4865.09px;">There is one conclusion to be drawn from this news report, six years after the
 United Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:5215.86px;">“heralded  a new and important step in the status of women” in the denomination. The fact was that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5566.62px;">our overall decline in the membership was already evident in 1962 and had been
 evident in the 50s. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5917.39px;">Were we being offered a “new role” for women in the hope it would stop the shrinking  in that half of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6268.15px;">our membership? Yes. To quote a UC document intended to create a positive spin
 on the plan, “All </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6618.92px;">this must lead to a stronger and better church.” Rather it served as a distraction from something of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6969.68px;">which many of us in the United Church were not really aware. The Untied Church,
 like many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7320.45px;">Protestant denominations, wasn't (still isn't) ready to face the implications of
 a new world where </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7671.21px;">overall change was happening at an accelerated rate.  And in some sectors, is now happening at a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8021.98px;">dizzying rate. But the United Church moves slowly; ever so slowly.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">At the beginning of the 20th century,  we note in an article elsewhere,  the concern in the Protestant </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">churches ( especially the Presbyterian and Anglican denomination) that young men
 were deserting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9274.27px;">the church in their late teens. Not young women,. Young men. And yet, with this
 evident loss to our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9625.04px;">numbers and loss to our potential male  leadership we persisted for over 50 years in leaving the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9975.80px;">whole central control of the church in the hands of men. We didn't think to
 include women in the </span>
