        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The story goes that James was in charge of the auger they were using for their
 drilling. Each time the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">auger was raised it was diligently examined (in the mud encrustation) for any
 signs of the precious </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">metal. One day, the story continues, James raised the auger, saw a piece of
 something in the mud, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">and quickly grabbed it and shoved it in his pocket. In doing this, he was seen
 by one of the groups’ </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">partners. He was questioned and he promised to show his find at the groups’ next meeting — but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">never relinquished it for examination. At this point the story has several
 different ending depending </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">on who tells it. One is that James simply returned to Scotland; another that
 James moved to the U.S. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">(possibly to the New England states); yet another that James quickly left the
 island and died shortly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">thereafter. (But, alas, God did not strike him down for his duplicity: we know
 for a fact </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">that James died in 1903 at the age of 81.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">For some writers the whole Pitblado incident — that the brothers “salted: their dig in The Money Pit” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-56.00px;top:4026.01px;">— was bogus. Nevertheless, digging continued after the Pitblado incident and the
 possibility of pirate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">gold still inspires people to dig there even to this day. And talk of the
 Pitblado brothers’ involvement </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">with Oak Island Gold can still be found on the Internet as part of the larger
 story. We are told that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">Charles Bruce was a young man of uncommon intelligence, and that his father,
 John, valued </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">education and supported his son’s studies. During that period of the boy’s study at the Normal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">School in Truro, John was employed in the construction of the Nova Scotia
 railway from Halifax </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">to Pictou. Charles Bruce worked with his father in the summers, earning money
 for his winter </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">studies. Unfortunately, John was killed in an explosion at Mount Uniake in 1857.
 This left Charles </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">Bruce, age 19, as the oldest son among ten siblings. Being the only family
 member with on-the-job </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">experience with the railway, he temporarily left education to complete his
 father’s contract </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">until a younger brother was old enough to take his place. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">After returning to his studies, Pitblado first was induced by Mr. Adams G.
 Archibald (afterwards </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba) to enter his law office. While thus engaged he
 decided that law </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">wasn’t the right profession for him, and he turned to studies related to church
 ministry; first at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">The Free Church College in Halifax, and then at Presbyterian Seminary in Truro.
 He completed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">his studied in 1865, becoming Reverend Charles Bruce Pitblado.</span>
