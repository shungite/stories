        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-19" style="">The Long Road To Ministry</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:551.60px;">Ernest’s academic road to ministry started in Toronto. He attempted to register at
 Victoria College. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:902.36px;">Their Honours courses in Philosophy, English and History were, he was told, an
 excellent foundation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1253.13px;">for his further studies. However the College required him to have background in
 Latin- he had none-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1603.89px;">and more Mathematics and Science than he had taken in St.John’s. On the other hand,, they said, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1954.66px;">steering him away from Victoria, Albert College in Belleville ,Ontario had an
 excellent program in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2305.42px;">tutoring students who needed to take more than the regular curriculum.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2856.19px;">Hence, his first year of university at Albert College included a full set of
 first year courses plus Latin, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3206.95px;">Mathematics and Science. He excelled. “Of course I had to work hard. But I had a room to myself </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3557.71px;">and I made it a practice to get up at 5:00 AM, wrap myself up in a carriage
 blanket ( the rooms </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3908.48px;">were dreadfully cold early morning in winter) and get in uninterrupted hours
 before breakfast.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4259.24px;">He excelled in his studies and also spent weekends preaching in a number of
 churches in that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4610.01px;">area of old Ontario. He also belonged to the debating society and joined the
 college’s rugby team </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4960.77px;">(he lacked weight but, as he said, he was a very fast runner!).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5511.54px;">He then needed that summer to earn money to continue his studies, he assumed, at
 Victoria College. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5862.30px;">But jobs were few and pay was minimal. At the end of the summer he still didn’t have the means </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6213.07px;">to register for university courses. This meant a year of earning before more
 learning.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6763.83px;">Despite the scarcity of jobs he managed to dig sewers with a pick and shovel,
 and clerk at Eaton’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7114.60px;">over Christmas. In the new year, despairing of finding anything worth while he
 applied to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7465.36px;">Church’s Superintendent of Home Missions for a job as a student minister in western
 Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7816.13px;">His application was accepted and he was placed in Forget, Saskatchewan, a home
 mission field </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8166.89px;">in southern Saskatchewan with three points; Forget, Ossa and Coteau.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8717.66px;">When he reached his mission he found that travel was a problem and there had
 been no provision </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9068.42px;">for it. There were no roads, only concession trails dividing up the land. He
 needed a horse, which to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9419.19px;">his surprise was then loaned to him by a local rancher. He boarded for a time in
 Forget and his horse, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9769.95px;">Ruby, ably carried him to his three congregations. Towards the end of his first
 year he reported to </span>
