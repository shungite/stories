        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Reid writes:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">We so thoroughly enjoyed the British television version of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:8032.64px;top:518.36px;">Brideshead Revisited</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:10627.01px;top:518.36px;">, that I thought the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">heading ‘Westminster Revisited’ was at least somewhat appropriate for this chapter. We, too, found </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">ourselves reliving our earlier years, 1946–1949, often reminiscing with parishioners about the glory </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">days back in the forties when the church was packed every Sunday morning; when
 an average </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Sunday evening service had an attendance of three or four hundred; when there
 were between 100 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">and 150 in the Apex Young People’s group; when I organized the junior youth group (mostly Grade 11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">and 12 young people) whose innovative programs were among the most imaginative I
 have ever seen. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">I’ll never forget the evening they conducted a funeral for “the church” — complete with a casket </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">(borrowed from Mordue’s Funeral Home). After a very impressive eulogy in which the church’s earlier </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">virtues were extolled, the casket was opened and those attending were invited to
 “please come </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">forward now to view the deceased.” How surprised we were when we looked in the silk-lined casket </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">to see ourselves, reflected in a mirror that had been appropriately placed at
 just the right angle in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">bottom of the casket!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">To return as senior minister after fourteen years was both an interesting and
 overwhelming (if not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">frightening) experience. As the young assistant (I was only thirty-two when we
 first went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">Westminster in 1946), I had been given quite wide-ranging responsibilities. Dr.
 Howse was an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">excellent senior minister, and one never had the feeling of simply being the
 assistant to the minister. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">I, too, was a minister, and he had the happy faculty of inspiring confidence in
 me by the way in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">which he left whole areas of work for me to do. He was always available when I
 wanted (or needed) to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">consult with him, but I never felt that he was peeking around the corner to see
 what I was doing. I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">had work to do, and he left me to it: the overall Christian education program,
 Sunday and mid-week, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">work with new members and confirmation classes, home and hospital visiting, and
 a limited amount </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">of preaching, except in the summer when I preached morning and evening from the
 last Sunday in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">June to Labour Day Sunday. In the summer, of course, I was in charge of all the
 work of the church—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">Sunday services, weddings, funerals, hospital visiting — the whole bit.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">So, to return fourteen years later as senior minister gave opportunity for much
 reminiscing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">those three years as assistant. The young people of the forties were now mature
 adults, and as </span>
