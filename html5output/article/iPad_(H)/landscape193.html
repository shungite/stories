        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">his youngest son!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">Competition in indoor and outdoor athletics between our groups and other
 churches in the city was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">keen. Churches did all this in early days. Community Clubs and schools did
 little; in fact few </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Community Clubs existed. Sunday School leagues had a large organization take
 care of athletic </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">meets, swim meets, basketball, hockey, soccer, lacrosse for the entire city. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">Westminster generally did very well and some photos are in our church vestibule.
  Winning medals </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">were provided in all leagues by the Griffon Club of Winnipeg to all sections
 from Midget to Senior. We </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">had a tough time in the hockey. One Sunday afternoon Miss Jessie Riddell, in
 charge of Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">School records, required the reason for seven new names suddenly appearing on
 our rolls with no </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">parent reference.They were the members of St. Margaret's Sunday School, ( =a
 neighbouring church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">on Westminster St.) who had won the cup the previous year in Hockey, and they
 decided to play for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Following the phenomenal growth of the Sunday School other organizations
 commenced a successful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">run of operations. Youth and Men’s clubs became active — the enthusiastic Bible class of Mr. John A. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">McAulay, Stan Jones and the Actimist Club — the large enrolment of a public speaking men’s club </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">gathered from all over this city, drew  at one time 3000 listeners attending a session in the Sanctuary , </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">the halls of the church and the Tivioli Theatre (across the street) — a selected group of young men </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">who spoke in churches in Brandon, Neepawa, Gladstone and other places.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">It has been my privilege to represent Westminster at Presbytery, Manitoba
 Conference, The World </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">Congress of Sunday School  Workers held in Toronto (where we had a delegation of seven), at A.O.T.S. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">conventions in Vancouver, Banff, Kingston and Halifax which we also enjoyed, and
 we have had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">busy, happy time.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">We have benefitted greatly in having the opportunity of association with the
 fine people of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">Westminster, and we have been proud of our church wherever visits were made.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">Looking backward the outstanding things in all the years have been the
 association with  the Boys’ </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">Department for many years, and later the 15 years editing the Westminster
 Newsletter.</span>
