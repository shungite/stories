 war. Allahyar was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">prepared to support his brother financially, emotionally and culturally. He
 wanted the documentation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">done by Westminster United Church as Immigration Canada would not accept his
 application as he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">was a student at University of Winnipeg. The Outreach Committee and the Board of
 the Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">accepted this application and it went through the process with Immigration
 Canada. Due to the 9/11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">attacks in New York City in 2001 there were numerous delays. On Sept. 29th, 2003
 Khalil Raza arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">at the Winnipeg airport to the absolute joy of his brother, Allahyar. The church
 gave him $500.00 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">clothing and some miscellaneous items to get started. He quickly became employed
 and excelled in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">his new home. He is married and now lives in Vancouver, B.C. Again a very
 successful sponsorship.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">3) Eric Rivera and his wife, Indrani Ospina and 4 sons had fled Columbia, South
 America in 1997. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Their journey to Canada was filled with terror and uncertainty. They were living
 in Winnipeg. On </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">April 22, 2002 they came to Westminster United Church asking for financial help.
 Their application </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">with Immigration Canada was due to run out on June 30th, 2002 and it cost
 $1300.00 for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">application. With the support of the Outreach Committee the money was given to
 them from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">Refugee Fund. They have remained in Winnipeg and went on to be excellent
 Canadian citizens.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">The Refugee Committee was recreated again in April, 2014. Phyllis Reader was the
 chair and Val </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">McIntyre was her assistant. (Val at left)They created an application form for “family reunification” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">sponsorship with Westminster United Church. The rationale was the church would
 not be financially </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">responsible for the refugee but the requesting applicant would take full
 responsibility for their family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">member. The Betty Halstead Refugee Fund would act as a slush fund if needed. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">There were several applicants. Phyllis and Val did interviews with recorded
 notes. In all cases the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">applicants proved not to be appropriate for the mandate of the committee.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">The committee is on hold at the present time due to the financial and
 ministerial circumstances of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">the church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">This report is written for the sole purpose of information and archival material
 on Refugee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">Sponsorships at Westminster United Church over the years.</span>
