        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:599.60px;">The first four men who ministered to the Westminster Congregation all hailed
 from Nova Scotia, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:950.36px;">the cradle of Canadian Scottish Presbyterianism. All were accounted as excellent
 preachers. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1301.13px;">All four ministries were each, in his own terms, successful.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1851.89px;">Charles Bruce Pitblado launched us in 1892 and later retired to the warmth of
 California. Clarence </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2202.66px;">MacKinnon saw us through a period of incredible growth and left us to return to
 Nova Scotia where </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2553.42px;">he became the head of Pine Hills Theological College. David Christie
 participated in the construction </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2904.19px;">of our present sanctuary and shepherded his Presbyterian congregation into the
 newly formed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3254.95px;">United Church of Canada. From these three, a solid beginning.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3805.71px;">However it was the fourth minister, John Sutherland Bonnell, who in his working
 lifetime, attracted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4156.48px;">the most attention, wielded the most extensive influence, and received both the
 greatest praise, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4507.24px;">the harshest criticism. His period of Westminster service, 1929 to 1935, was all
 within the decade of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4858.01px;">the Great Depression. It was also a period of European unrest that would
 eventually impinge on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5208.77px;">Americas, Asia and the rest of the world.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-19" style="top:5791.94px;">The Year Was 1929</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6343.54px;">The World was not yet Marshall McLuhan’s Global Village. Nevertheless we had the marvels of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6694.30px;">telegraph and the telephone, and newspapers which kept us abreast of the world
 beyond our own. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7045.07px;">By the 1940s going to the movies inevitably entailed a Newsreel detailing the
 fighting overseas before </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7395.83px;">the main show. Fast, efficient communication was drawing us together. Where
 Westminster’s second </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7746.60px;">minister, Clarence McKinnon had crossed the Atlantic many times by sailing ship
 and the uncertain </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8097.36px;">power of wind, by 1929 for David Christie our third minister passage across all
 earth’s seas was by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8448.13px;">steam and coal in large , comfortable, vessels. The reality of connectedness as
 we know it today </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8798.89px;">was in its infancy but our awareness of things beyond was being sharpened.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9349.66px;">World War One, the “war to end all wars,” was already eleven years behind us. Governments </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9700.42px;">in Europe, Asia and North America were looking at a variety of ways to meet the
 needs </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10051.19px;">of their different social orders.</span>
