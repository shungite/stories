        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Italy, the country, was only 58 years old. Long before World War One the Italian
 government policy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">of irredentism (read ‘emancipation’) had been in practice. The country was adding — by force if </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">necessary — islands and cities beyond their borders. Their pretext, flimsy but useful. was
 that Italian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">was spoken in these areas. By 1929 this policy of expansion had morphed into
 Fascism a form of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">radical authoritarian nationalism. Mussolini was not far behind.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Communism, by an act of revolution, was established in Russia.  Its sister ideology Socialism </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">was the choice of the French. The Lyons Congress (1878) advocated “emancipation of workers,” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">and “collective ownership of the soil’’ By the opening of the twentieth century France had clearly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">become a socialist country. Not Communist, but Socialist. (Clarence McKinnon, in
 his book </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:3324.48px;">Reminiscences</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:1797.03px;top:3324.48px;">, mentions this socialist development in France as “worrisome”).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">The Russian revolt against the Tzar spawned the Communist Party with it’s vain hope of peacefully </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">changing the minds and activities of 163,000,000 Russians.The French Revolution
 successfully </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">spawned Socialism and America’s War of Independence spawned what we know today as American-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">style Democracy. In Canada? Well, we had no need of a revolt. We had the Queen
 and we were busy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">building a country. And we didn’t have to go looking for an ideology. If you accept John Ralston Saul’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">thesis in his book, A Fair Country, Canada has been deeply influenced and shaped
 by Aboriginal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">ideas and by the experience of both Francophone and Anglophone immigrants over
 the 250 years, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">from 1600 on, during which Aboriginals were either the dominant force in Canada,
 or equal partners.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">By 1929, there was a plethora of competing political ideologies: to Communism,
 Fascism, Socialism </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">and Democracy we need to add German Nazism. The German Worker’s Party a pan-German </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">nationalist and antisemitic party of which Hitler seized power in 1920 was the
 precursor of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">National Socialist Party (NAZI Party). In 1933 the Nazi Party held the largest
 elected majority </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">in the Reichstag and Hitler became Chancellor.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">In 1927 John Sutherland Bonnell, a man of considerable intelligence, seemingly
 boundless energy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">and a lover of ideas was in London, England, taking post-graduate studies — on leave from his church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">posting, St. Andrew’s Presbyterian in St. John, New Brunswick. He had been in Europe during WW I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">(twice wounded and a victim of a poison gas attack), and his interest in the
 continent was turning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10238.25px;">his mind in that direction.</span>
