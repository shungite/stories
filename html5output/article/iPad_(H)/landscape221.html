        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Betty returned to Canada, one of their goals was to raise enough money to
 supplement Dwight’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">salary, so that the work they were doing as volunteers, could be taken over by
 Romanian workers. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Churches, service clubs, and individuals in our area helped them largely reach
 that goal. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">In 2006, Lorraine went back to her babies in Romania. She spent over a month
 there in May — this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">time alone — but she was really happy to see the unbelievable difference that one year had
 made in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">the reactions of the babies. She said that she would never had thought of
 adopting any of the babies </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">she saw the previous year, because they would all have psychological problems
 resulting from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">neglect. But in one year, the fact that babies were being held to be fed,
 cuddled and played with, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">meant that they seemed like normal healthy children who would grow up with a
 future! She also </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">marvelled at the difference in the hospital personnel. The results of this
 program that they had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">witnessed, greatly influenced their attitudes, so that they started treating the
 babies as people, rather </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">than seeing the hospital as a warehouse to shelter them. Finally, Lorraine was
 also pleased to see </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">how the money which had been collected here in the Okanagan was providing
 salaries for good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Romanian workers who were making all the difference to the work there. Dwight
 said that they had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">become one of the Foundation’s most important sources of funding!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Of course, Lorraine was talking about going back to Oradea again, and this time,
 Bob was going to go </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">with her. Plans had not been set, but the talk was of doing a vacation trip
 around eastern Europe </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">when the volunteer work was done. Unfortunately, Lorraine’s death in 2008 put an end to that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">dreaming. One positive final note was that Lorraine’s obituary named the Foundation in Romania, as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">one recipient of memorial gifts, and several thousand dollars were contributed.
 The Foundation used </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">the money to renovate and furnish a large room in a church in one of the Roma
 villages they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">working in, near Oradea. To the room were added washrooms and showers and it was
 used to gather </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">the village children for activities, socializing, and Christian education. The
 room was dedicated in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">Lorraine’s memory, and that would have pleased her immensely. </span>
