        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">school teachers will tell you how directed experience in the child’s environment can still be play and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">yet have structure and purpose. The Staff of the Centre  is challenged as much as classroom teachers </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">are dealing with children who have different levels of development, experience
 and ability even </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">within a play environment.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">The Centre, then, becomes  an integral part of the children's development and works to develop </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">cooperation with the children's school and with their parents. To make the
 point; the Centre is not a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">holding facility for children whose parents are at work. It is part of
 children's development, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">intellectually and socially. A far cry today from when Westminster started an
 out-reach activity to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">relieve pressure on working parents.</span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:4626.01px;">Bob and Lorraine and children came to us in 1979 after Reid and Dorothy Vipond
 moved east. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:4976.77px;">Following is material written in September of that year by Betty Halstead when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:5327.54px;">she was Vice Chair of the Board:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5878.30px;">The Thompsons are both natives of Alberta. Bob earned an Education degree in
 Calgary and then </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6229.07px;">moved to St. Stephen’s College in Edmonton. Here, two things affected the direction of his life: he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6579.83px;">completed his Theological training and met Lorraine Lareome who was in nursing
 training. They </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">were married in the summer of 1966, and were placed in their first pastorate in
 Morley, a small town </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">between Calgary and Banff, to serve a community of Stoney Indians for two years.
 At the end of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">assigned two years, the elders asked them to stay, but, since an Indian minister
 originally from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">reserve wished to return, they resigned. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8533.66px;">As a result of an application to the United Church Board of World Missions, to
 do missionary work </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">somewhere in Asia, they were assigned to Japan.The first two years were spent in
 Tokyo studying the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">language and doing some counselling with an English Church youth group. In 1970
 they were placed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">in a ‘new town’ area of 130,000 people. The town was a suburb of Osaka — and they could see the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">sight of Expo ‘70 from their window. </span>
