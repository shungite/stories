        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">now has a most attractive chapel which seats sixty or seventy people. By
 interesting coincidence, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">first of many funerals I conducted in the chapel was that young architect’s aunt (one of the Riddell </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">family). The second funeral was for the mother of Ted Millman, chairman of the
 chapel building </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">committee. There have been many weddings, including Doug and Jane’s on August 25, 1972. We have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">had Sunday school teachers’ communion services. Many groups use it for at least the devotional part </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">of their meeting. And on only one occasion that I know of did we pull the
 reredos drape to turn the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">chapel into an ordinary meeting room!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Before we came to Westminster, there had been much discussion about
 discontinuing the Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">evening service. Attendance was often as low as twenty-five or thirty people,
 compared to the five to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">seven hundred at 11 a.m. But there was the usual reluctance in the Session to
 take such a step </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">despite the low attendance and the fact that only a couple of elders ever
 attended. Also, as Dr. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">Leathers pointed out, twenty-five to thirty people is still ten times the
 biblical requirement! And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">anyway, maybe they should wait until the new minister came. Maybe he would have
 some brilliant </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">ideas about building up a thriving evening congregation,</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">I soon assured them that I had no magic tricks up my sleeve, and suggested that
 we should look at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">an alternative to the service in the sanctuary. We began with a Sunday evening
 discussion group in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">the lecture hall. We had a speaker, followed by small groups, followed by tea
 and cookies.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">That went well for a year or so. Then, we tried monthly meetings. But, before
 too long, we gave up on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">any regular Sunday evening gatherings, leaving ourselves open for “special events” as the need arose. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Strangely enough, there were very few special events, not even at anniversary
 time. The Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">evening services actually passed away peacefully! We didn’t even conduct a memorial service for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">them.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Westminster has always been a congregation that has reached out to the
 community. Stories abound </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">of the hundreds of servicemen during World War I who used the spacious gym and
 church hall for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">recreational purposes. Indeed, at one point in those early years, they had a
 pool table in one of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">basement rooms, much to the disgust of the Wednesday evening prayer meeting
 group who prayed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">fervently that “this wicked thing would soon be removed from our premises.” That prayer must have </span>
