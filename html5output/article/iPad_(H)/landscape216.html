        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The church sanctuary, halls, and meeting rooms are used by many groups in the
 city. The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Chamber Orchestra has its four or five concerts each year in the sanctuary, and
 the orchestra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">members use most of the facilities for rehearsing. At times, it was somewhat a
 nuisance, but this was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">offset for me by the personal joy to give over my vestry to many guest artists.
 I remember best of all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Liona Boyd, Ivan Moravec, Elmer Iseler, and the Canadian Brass.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Several high schools still have their June graduations in the sanctuary. Mrs.
 Litz’s Mennonite </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Children’s Choir made several of their records in our church. The Winnipeg Ladies Choir,
 mainly a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Mennonite choir, also used the sanctuary. The acoustics are excellent, and even
 more important, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">welcome mat was always out.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Many other community groups use the excellent facilities at Westminster. At
 election time, we had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">all-candidates’ meetings. Several organizations, such as the Peace Action Committee, use space
 on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">our third-floor meeting hall (called the concert hall after the stage was
 erected in the early seventies). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">For a number of years, the gym was used each Sunday afternoon for recreation and
 refreshments for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">ex-psychiatric patients, men and women, who used to be at the Selkirk Mental
 Hospital, but who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5355.79px;">were now living in the community. The program “Mothers</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-60" style="left:8007.75px;top:5332.41px;">ʼ</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8070.05px;top:5355.79px;"> Morning Off” is still going strong. And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5752.48px;">again, the list goes on.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6854.01px;">Despite the number of pages in this account of “Westminster Revisited,” I have said nothing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7204.78px;">my involvement with the mission board. In 1965 I was asked to be the conference
 convenor of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7555.54px;">Overseas Missions Committee, which, apart from chairing conference committee
 meetings, meant a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7906.31px;">four-day meeting in Toronto each November. It also meant an involvement in the
 Prairie Conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8257.07px;">on World Mission, an ecumenical and international meeting for two days each
 spring of clergy and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8607.84px;">laity from Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Northwestern Ontario, as well as people
 from North and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8958.60px;">South Dakota and Minnesota. Both the national church boards and the cross-border
 ecumenical </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9309.37px;">programs were interesting and, I think, worthwhile.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9860.13px;">The interfaith contacts were also very valuable, especially to meet monthly or
 so with clergy, priests, </span>
