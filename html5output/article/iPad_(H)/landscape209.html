        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Leathers pointed out, twenty-five to thirty people is still ten times the
 biblical requirement! And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">anyway, maybe they should wait until the new minister came. Maybe he would have
 some brilliant </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">ideas about building up a thriving evening congregation,</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">I soon assured them that I had no magic tricks up my sleeve, and suggested that
 we should look at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">an alternative to the service in the sanctuary. We began with a Sunday evening
 discussion group in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">the lecture hall. We had a speaker, followed by small groups, followed by tea
 and cookies.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">That went well for a year or so. Then, we tried monthly meetings. But, before
 too long, we gave up on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">any regular Sunday evening gatherings, leaving ourselves open for “special events” as the need arose. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Strangely enough, there were very few special events, not even at anniversary
 time. The Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">evening services actually passed away peacefully! We didn’t even conduct a memorial service for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">them.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:4426.01px;">Westminster has always been a congregation that has reached out to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:4776.77px;">community. Stories abound of the hundreds of servicemen during World </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:5127.54px;">War I who used the spacious gym and church hall for recreational </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:5478.30px;">purposes. Indeed, at one point in those early years, they had a pool table </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:5829.07px;">in one of the basement rooms, much to the disgust of the Wednesday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:6179.83px;">evening prayer meeting group who prayed fervently that “this wicked </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:6530.60px;">thing would soon be removed from our premises.” That prayer must have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:6881.36px;">been answered, because when the pool table was worn out, it was never </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:7232.13px;">replaced.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:7782.89px;">Shortly after we arrived in 1963, there were discussions about some kind </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:8133.66px;">of church-sponsored child care on a permanent basis. As early as 1948 or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3677.57px;top:8484.42px;">1949, there had been a weekday play school that our two-year-old Francie </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">(as the minister’s child) was allowed to attend, though the lower age limit was three. But, by
 1965, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">with the active assistance of Mrs. Gretta Brown (daughter of the late Charles W.
 Gordon—“Ralph </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">Connor”), we looked at the possibility of a lunch and after- school program for the
 kindergarten to </span>
