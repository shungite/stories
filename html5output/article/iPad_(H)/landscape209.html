        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">communication within a church. Despite the Good Book to the contrary, the left
 hand should know </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">what the right is doing!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Another problem with the board structure at Westminster (common in many
 churches) was that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">there seemed to be no terminal point for many office holders. For example, when
 we went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Westminster in 1963, the same man had been clerk of Session for a dozen years or
 more and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">same person had held the position as chairman of Stewards for ten years. Also,
 there were only three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">or four women on these boards.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">To discuss possible changes, we organized a four-hour session, which we called a
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">forum. This may have been where the idea was born, viz., to have one church
 board as the governing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">body of our congregation. Out of that idea we decided to have three groups meet—the executives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">the UCW, of Stewards, and of Session—together with staff. It is not possible to describe all that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">happened in that year of monthly meetings. But it soon became apparent how much
 overlapping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">there was: e.g., both the UCW and the stewards had finance and property
 committees; both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">Session and the UCW had a mission committee and a flower committee, to give only
 a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">examples. As well, there were times when people had to report to both Stewards
 and Session, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">maybe, as well, to the Official Board. It was a clumsy and an inefficient type
 of organization. But, in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">setting up a new board structure, we had to make certain that all the work of
 the congregation would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">be covered, yet not duplicated. Also, we wanted to make certain that there would
 be a good mix of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">women, men, and young people on the board. We wanted to be certain, too, that
 there would be a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">time limit for any one person to serve.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">We began the discussion and study of a possible new structure of congregational
 government at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">beginning of 1969, and the final report was presented to the congregational
 meeting in January 1970. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">It was approved. The General Board (as we decided to call it) would be made up
 of nine committees, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">with four persons on each committee—worship, education, finance, property, communications, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">membership and visiting, fellowship, outreach, and nominations. There would also
 be a chairperson, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">vice chair, secretary, and treasurer, with the staff as ex officio members. Each
 board member would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">serve a four-year term, and the chair would change every second year. Each of
 the nine committees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">could add to their numbers for their own committee tasks, but all major
 decisions would be brought </span>
