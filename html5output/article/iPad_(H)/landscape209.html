 latterly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">held services in the gymnasium of the church on Sundays at the same time as the
 traditional service </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">in the Sanctuary.</span>

        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="left:8362.38px;top:1210.14px;">   </span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1809.74px;">For Lorraine, the culmination of a long held dream began in March </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2160.50px;">and April 2005, when she went to Romania to look after orphan babies! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2711.27px;">Orphan babies, you say? Where did that come from? She never did talk about her
 motivation, but the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3062.03px;">answer seemed obvious. Almost all of her nursing career had been spent working
 in nurseries in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3412.80px;">Japan, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and for a short time in Vernon. She loved taking
 care of babies and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3763.56px;">developed a great skill in doing that.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4314.33px;">Romania, you say? Actually, this dream started for Lorraine with no thought of
 Romania. For ages, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4665.09px;">she had talked about going somewhere, where she could care for orphan babies — the obvious choice </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5015.86px;">seemed to be Africa, where Aids was causing so many orphans, but trying to find
 a place who would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5366.62px;">take volunteer workers for a short term became more of a challenge than you
 might have thought. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5917.39px;">The other obstacle had been, that she had been trying to enlist Bob on this new
 adventure, but with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6268.15px;">no idea of where she was going or for how long she would be there, Bob was
 reluctant. He had other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6618.92px;">thing he wanted to do with his retirement.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7169.68px;">Finally, at Christmas time in 2004, Lorraine made up her mind that 2005 was
 going to be the year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7520.45px;">and in a matter of a week or two, through a friend of a friend, she was given
 the name of Dwight </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7871.21px;">DeLong, an American who has started a foundation in Romania for caring for
 orphans. She emailed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8221.98px;">him and asked if he had any volunteer work for a 59 year old woman who just
 wanted to cuddle </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">babies. He said come ahead, and that she did. Another woman from the church
 asked if she could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">join the expedition, and plans moved so quickly for the two of them, that
 Lorraine’s passport arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9274.27px;">on a Friday, just in time for her Monday departure. She flew from Kelowna to
 Vancouver to Frankfurt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9625.04px;">to Budapest in Hungary, where she was picked up by a van, and driven just three
 hours, over the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9975.80px;">Romanian border to Oradea. </span>
