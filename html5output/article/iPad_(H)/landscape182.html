        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">our overall decline in the membership was already evident in 1962 and had been
 evident in the 50s. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Were we being offered a “new role” for women in the hope it would stop the shrinking  in that half of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">our membership? Yes. To quote a UC document intended to create a positive spin
 on the plan, “All </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">this must lead to a stronger and better church.” Rather it served as a distraction from something of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">which many of us in the United Church were not really aware. The Untied Church,
 like many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Protestant denominations, wasn't (still isn't) ready to face the implications of
 a new world where </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">overall change was happening at an accelerated rate.  And in some sectors, is now happening at a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">dizzying rate. But the United Church moves slowly; ever so slowly.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">At the beginning of the 20th century,  we note in an article elsewhere,  the concern in the Protestant </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">churches ( especially the Presbyterian and Anglican denomination) that young men
 were deserting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">the church in their late teens. Not young women,. Young men. And yet, with this
 evident loss to our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">numbers and loss to our potential male  leadership we persisted for over 50 years in leaving the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">whole central control of the church in the hands of men. We didn't think to
 include women in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">important areas of concern.We simply worked harder to keep young men involved.
 Sports, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">fellowship.More sports. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">I think of my own home (time period- 1930-1950) where mother was never apprised
 of how much </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">money my father was earning. He gave her an allowance to run the house. No
 questions asked. No </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">information shared. If she had the need to buy an article of clothing she had to
 ask father for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">money. He would decide. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">This inbred belief that a woman couldn't make the big decisions was in both our
 micro and macro </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">worlds. Then, sometime in the early 1950s someone (or someones) encouraged
 people in the United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">Church to recognize this male blindness. It took 9 years (1953 -62),  “painstaking study” and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:8284.42px;">“wrestling with the problem” to turn this thinking around. it took another 8 years for Westminster to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">shuck off its Elders and Session and institute a General Board. With women.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">The most visible leader in the  move to create a General Board was Marilyn Huband. I could  suggest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">others, also, where instrumental on the process. But Marilyn became ground zero.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">In 1968 Mrs. C. R. Huband (Marilyn) was elected President of Winipeg
 Presbyterial (note the the last 4 </span>
