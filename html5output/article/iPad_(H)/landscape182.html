        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">One event each year was the congregational picnic at the parks. One year we
 hired a C.N.R. four or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">five coach train, sold tickets all over Winnipeg and spent the Saturday
 afternoon at Victoria Beach. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">They gave me $200.00 to buy prizes and we spent it all. When the races started
 every person or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">stranger at Victoria Beach turned up to get in on the races and the grand prize
 list. Senator John T. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Haig acted as our policeman and saw to it that no-one took part unless they were
 connected with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">In the early twenties many of the large homes in the vicinity of Westminster
 were occupied by our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">members and their large families. The result was our Sunday School had a large
 attendance and at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">one time we had the largest Sunday School enrolment of any Presbyterian Church
 in Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">We had a boys’ department of around 150 boys between 12 and 17. This Department had been well </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">organized by the late Walter MacDonald and he had a powerful executive which met
 frequently on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">plans and projects — Colonel J.D. Sinclair, T.D. Patton, M. McCracken, B.V. Richardson, Wm. Bonellie,
 J. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">R. Major, and I was included as I was running the gym classes twice a week.  Class space was hard to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">find. Two classes in the kitchen, 6 or 7 on the gym floor (Lower Hall), one each
 in the hall, the men's </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">washroom, the vestry, and the  shower dressing room ( the latter usually erupted  in weekly disaster). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Wm. Hurst was assistant on records and he usually caused an upset when coming in
 weeding </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">through the classes wearing a large racoon coat. Curriculum teachers’ book were poor and teachers </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">hard to find.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">We had four religious denominations teaching at a time. We followed the Tuxis
 and Trail Ranger </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">badge award systems and several times we held annual Bible examinations. This
 was apparently </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">unique as Manitoba College (a Presbyterian college) sent over prof. Dr. Fred
 Kerr and one other to look </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">us over. We had over 100 boys take part.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">One afternoon one class had a sound recorder take a record of pupils taking part
 in the lesson. One </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">lad had the part of repeating the Lord's Prayer; he had been interrupted , lost
 the trend and could not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">continue. Dr. Christie (Westminster’s third Minister) happened to drop in so we gave him a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">demonstration of class working. When he listened to a boy who could not repeat
 the Lord’s Prayer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">(on the recording)  he demanded the name of the parents so he could call on them. The culprit was </span>
