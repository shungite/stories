        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Bert can tell his own story. The Annual Meeting he alludes to in the beginning
 took place in 1972 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">during the Ministry of Reid Vipond, the same year this document was written …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:869.13px;">“At the Annual Meeting of Westminster held in the Sanctuary this year Dr. Vipond
 was kind enough </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">to draw attention to the fact that I had completed 53 years of activity in this
 church and invited the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">congregation to give suitable recognition. I am deeply grateful to our minister
 for making this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">reference.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">Fifty three years is a short period in life’s record and I have enjoyed every bit of it and am thankful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">that I had the opportunity of being associated with such fine people in serving
 the Master.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3373.72px;">When I arrived in Winnipeg in 1919 I made a habit of visiting various churches
 to determine what </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">part of the city I would live in.I dropped into Westminster one September
 evening and was delighted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">to find that a Boys' Conference was being held and the speaker was Mr. Taylor
 Staten. He is the man </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">who started Tuxis and Trail Rangers — a great friend of mine. He spotted me in the congregation and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">told the Conference the story of three lads from Calgary who came to the Lake of
 The Woods in 1910 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">to a Boys’ Conference. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">He related that two of them had given their lives in the First World War, and he
 had had a visit with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">the remaining one a few months earlier while lecturing to troops during the
 march of occupation in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">Germany; I had obtained leave and had travelled 20 kilometres to listen to my
 friend. Taylor Staten </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">then asked me to come up to the pulpit and say a few words. Although that was my
 introduction to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Westminster, I really had the Westminster table pinned on me many years before I
 ever heard of this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">The next evening a group of 12 year old lads called at my room in the Y and
 invited me to come as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">their teacher. An auspicious start.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">Westminster has always had grand ministers and very able associates. When pulpit
 supply was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">required, outstanding ministers or laymen fro all corners of the east preached.
 They included our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">own church missionary from China and our own Sunday School missionary from
 India.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10136.72px;">A large Bible was kept on the pulpit which visitors and preachers signed. Names
 such as Dr. Grenfell  </span>
