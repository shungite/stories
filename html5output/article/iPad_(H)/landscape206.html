        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Shortly after we arrived in 1963, there were discussions about some kind of
 church-sponsored child </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">care on a permanent basis. As early as 1948 or 1949, there had been a weekday
 play school that our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">two-year-old Francie (as the minister’s child) was allowed to attend, though the lower age limit was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1019.89px;">three. But, by 1965, with the active assistance of Mrs. Gretta Brown (daughter
 of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1370.66px;">the late Charles W. Gordon—“Ralph Connor”), we looked at the possibility of a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1721.42px;">lunch and after- school program for the kindergarten to Grade 3 boys and girls </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2072.19px;">of nearby Mulvey School who were children of sole-support working mothers. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2422.95px;">After a year of planning, getting the program officially recognized by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2773.72px;">provincial government, and with funding in place by the church, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3124.48px;">government and the mothers, the project began. Major funding was eventually </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3475.25px;">picked up by the government, with the church supplying all the facilities and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3826.01px;">the volunteers. We began with one staff person and twenty-five or so children. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4176.77px;">The program has grown, and for many years has had two workers and forty to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4527.54px;">fifty children. A large group of volunteers assist at meal time. All equipment </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4878.30px;">has been upgraded to fulfill the Board of Health requirements. Members of the
 congregation carry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5229.07px;">most of the responsibility for the work of the child care board. It is such a
 well-established program </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5579.83px;">that one couldn’t imagine Westminster without it.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">The church sanctuary, halls, and meeting rooms are used by many groups in the
 city. The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">Chamber Orchestra has its four or five concerts each year in the sanctuary, and
 the orchestra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">members use most of the facilities for rehearsing. At times, it was somewhat a
 nuisance, but this was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">offset for me by the personal joy to give over my vestry to many guest artists.
 I remember best of all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">Liona Boyd, Ivan Moravec, Elmer Iseler, and the Canadian Brass.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">Several high schools still have their June graduations in the sanctuary. Mrs.
 Litz’s Mennonite </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">Children’s Choir made several of their records in our church. The Winnipeg Ladies Choir,
 mainly a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">Mennonite choir, also used the sanctuary. The acoustics are excellent, and even
 more important, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">welcome mat was always out.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">Many other community groups use the excellent facilities at Westminster. At
 election time, we had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">all-candidates’ meetings. Several organizations, such as the Peace Action Committee, use space
 on </span>
