        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:-32.40px;">Bob and Lorraine and children came to us in 1979 after Reid and Dorothy Vipond
 moved east. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:318.36px;">Following is material written in September of that year by Betty Halstead when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:669.13px;">she was Vice Chair of the Board:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1219.89px;">The Thompsons are both natives of Alberta. Bob earned an Education degree in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1570.66px;">Calgary and then moved to St. Stephen’s College in Edmonton. Here, two things </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1921.42px;">affected the direction of his life: he completed his Theological training and
 met </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2272.19px;">Lorraine Lareome who was in nursing training. They were married in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2622.95px;">summer of 1966, and were placed in their first pastorate in Morley, a small </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2973.72px;">town between Calgary and Banff, to serve a community of Stoney Indians for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3324.48px;">two years. At the end of the assigned two years, the elders asked them to stay, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3675.25px;">but, since an Indian minister originally from the reserve wished to return, they
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4026.01px;">resigned. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">As a result of an application to the United Church Board of World Missions, to
 do missionary work </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">somewhere in Asia, they were assigned to Japan.The first two years were spent in
 Tokyo studying the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">language and doing some counselling with an English Church youth group. In 1970
 they were placed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">in a ‘new town’ area of 130,000 people. The town was a suburb of Osaka — and they could see the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">sight of Expo ‘70 from their window. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">Here, from 1970 to 1975, Bob worked with a a Japanese Senior minister. Because
 the new towns had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">policy of “no church buildings” Bob organized the third “house church” — the congregation meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">in a rented hall. Because the building was used for other purposes during the
 week, Bob’s car trunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">became the storage area for the pulpit, the church library and tapes with the
 hymns and speakers to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">play them through. Each Sunday’s worship was preceded by a rapid few moments of furniture </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">moving! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">At Christmas, 1975, Bob was called to St. Andrews-Wesley in Vancouver* as an
 assistant minister </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">responsible for Outreach and Christian Education. During his one year furlough
 from Japan, he had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">worked there while taking training in high-rise apartment ministry.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">And now the Thompsons have come to the Prairies with their three children;
