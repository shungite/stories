        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">terms, the Session has oversight over things spiritual, the Stewards over things
 temporal, and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Official Board is a combination of these two (plus presidents of all
 organizations). Also, it has the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">power to act on behalf of the congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">But there has always been a problem here. Why should we divide the spiritual and
 the temporal? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Aren’t they all of a piece, really? Why should one particular group (the Stewards) do
 all the property </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">work, and even more especially, all the financial decisions? Granted, all
 decisions are supposed to be </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">checked by the Official Board, but this is usually only rubber-stamping. Also,
 it makes difficult </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">communication within a church. Despite the Good Book to the contrary, the left
 hand should know </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">what the right is doing!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Another problem with the board structure at Westminster (common in many
 churches) was that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">there seemed to be no terminal point for many office holders. For example, when
 we went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Westminster in 1963, the same man had been clerk of Session for a dozen years or
 more and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">same person had held the position as chairman of Stewards for ten years. Also,
 there were only three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">or four women on these boards.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">To discuss possible changes, we organized a four-hour session, which we called a
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">forum. This may have been where the idea was born, viz., to have one church
 board as the governing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">body of our congregation. Out of that idea we decided to have three groups meet—the executives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">the UCW, of Stewards, and of Session—together with staff. It is not possible to describe all that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">happened in that year of monthly meetings. But it soon became apparent how much
 overlapping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">there was: e.g., both the UCW and the stewards had finance and property
 committees; both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">Session and the UCW had a mission committee and a flower committee, to give only
 a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">examples. As well, there were times when people had to report to both Stewards
 and Session, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">maybe, as well, to the Official Board. It was a clumsy and an inefficient type
 of organization. But, in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">setting up a new board structure, we had to make certain that all the work of
 the congregation would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">be covered, yet not duplicated. Also, we wanted to make certain that there would
 be a good mix of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">women, men, and young people on the board. We wanted to be certain, too, that
 there would be a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">time limit for any one person to serve.</span>
