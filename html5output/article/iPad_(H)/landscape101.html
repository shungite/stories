        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">His first posting was at Tilt Cove. His second was at Twillingate where in 1902
 Ernest was born; </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">a baby who would become The Very Reverend Ernest Marshal Frazer Howse,
 Westminster’s fifth </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">minister and eventually the 21st Moderator of The United Church of Canada.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:1219.89px;">Ernest had only the vaguest memories of Twillingate or his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:1570.66px;">father’s next posting to Burin, a village at the south end of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:1921.42px;">the Island accessible only by sea. He did remember that It </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:2272.19px;">was at Burin where he and his father had their first ride in a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:2622.95px;">trap-skiff powered by a motor. (Traditionally trap-skiffs were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:2973.72px;">powered by two oarsmen at each side and one at the back to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:3324.48px;">steer.Such boats were used to work cod fish traps). In the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:5470.08px;top:3675.25px;">long story of NFLD fishing the introduction of motor powered </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">boats was a seminal moment. While oared skiffs continued for a time the motor
 eventually replaced </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">the arduous labour of rowing 30 foot boats loaded with fish. These motors (5 hp
 single cylinder </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">engines) went “putt-putt-putt” and moved the boats (according to Ernest) at the amazing speed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">of three miles per hour. That was enough. Life was a bit easier. The picture
 shows a motorized </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">skiff at the trap, the men loading the boat with their catch.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">Ernest’s most vivid memories as a child were at Blackhead near Harbour Grace
 (historically the place </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">where Methodism in North America first took root.). He tells how the family
 landed at Carbonear met </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">by a cortege of horses and carriages, and was then driven twelve miles to
 Blackhead. He complains </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">that he had to sit at the back of the carriage looking backward.This didn’t please him but he allows </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">he enjoyed the ride anyway. He would have been coming on nine at the time.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">Blackhead was a 3-point charge for his father who weekly had to preach at three
 services: Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">morning — Adam Cove to the north, Sunday afternoon-Broad Cove to the south and Blackhead
 in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">centre in the evening. The evening service, traditionally was the most important
 service of the day. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">In these small, remote villages, the church service was the most important event
 of the week.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">The Howse family lived on $900 a year. In bad times as little as $750 a year.
 This salary was paid </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">when there was money in the village — for example when the fish were sold in the fall. Socks and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10238.25px;">mitts were knit and mended by mother. They had a servant girl in lieu of washing
 machines and </span>
