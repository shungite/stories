        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">We had four religious denominations teaching at a time. We followed the Tuxis
 and Trail Ranger </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">badge award systems and several times we held annual Bible examinations. This
 was apparently </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">unique as Manitoba College (a Presbyterian college) sent over prof. Dr. Fred
 Kerr and one other to look </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">us over. We had over 100 boys take part.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">One afternoon one class had a sound recorder take a record of pupils taking part
 in the lesson. One </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">lad had the part of repeating the Lord's Prayer; he had been interrupted , lost
 the trend and could not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">continue. Dr. Christie (Westminster’s third Minister) happened to drop in so we gave him a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">demonstration of class working. When he listened to a boy who could not repeat
 the Lord’s Prayer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">(on the recording)  he demanded the name of the parents so he could call on them. The culprit was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">his youngest son!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Competition in indoor and outdoor athletics between our groups and other
 churches in the city was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">keen. Churches did all this in early days. Community Clubs and schools did
 little; in fact few </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">Community Clubs existed. Sunday School leagues had a large organization take
 care of athletic </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">meets, swim meets, basketball, hockey, soccer, lacrosse for the entire city. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">Westminster generally did very well and some photos are in our church vestibule.
  Winning medals </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">were provided in all leagues by the Griffon Club of Winnipeg to all sections
 from Midget to Senior. We </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">had a tough time in the hockey. One Sunday afternoon Miss Jessie Riddell, in
 charge of Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">School records, required the reason for seven new names suddenly appearing on
 our rolls with no </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">parent reference.They were the members of St. Margaret's Sunday School, ( =a
 neighbouring church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">on Westminster St.) who had won the cup the previous year in Hockey, and they
 decided to play for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Following the phenomenal growth of the Sunday School other organizations
 commenced a successful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">run of operations. Youth and Men’s clubs became active — the enthusiastic Bible class of Mr. John A. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">McAulay, Stan Jones and the Actimist Club — the large enrolment of a public speaking men’s club </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">gathered from all over this city, drew  at one time 3000 listeners attending a session in the Sanctuary , </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">the halls of the church and the Tivioli Theatre (across the street) — a selected group of young men </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">who spoke in churches in Brandon, Neepawa, Gladstone and other places.</span>
