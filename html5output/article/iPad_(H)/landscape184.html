        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Westminster United Church since WW I (a scant two years after the present
 building was completed). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Through many decades this group provided hundreds of quilts, layettes, afghans,
 knitted hats, mitts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">&amp; scarves to needy people, all over the world. For example in 1937, 25 quilts
 given to the ‘needy; in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">1942, 26 quilts and 48 “warm garments” shipped overseas and another 6 quilts sent to fresh air </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">camps; in 1943, 30 quilts and afghans sent to the Red Cross to be part of their
 V(ictory) bundles, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">19 layettes and many knitted garments were distributed in Winnipeg. Westminster
 women sent their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">crafted items to Europe, Korea, Angola, to small communities in Northern
 Manitoba, and locally to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">the Christmas Cheer Board, Stella Avenue Mission and as close to home as Mulvey
 School. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Since the 1980s the central group has limited its efforts to quilting. Today’s quilting is done-to-order. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Privately owned quilt tops are brought in and the group creates the finished
 quilt for a fee which is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">donated to the church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Recently, knitting became the activity of choice for many volunteers, working at
 home and in church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">They have continued to produce mitts, scarves, etc., for the Christmas season
 mitten tree. Another </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">group of knitters was formed in 2005 to produce prayer shawls.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">Few historic names have been recorded of the women taking part in this activity
 over the years. One </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">person, Mrs. James McKenzie set a record in 1966 when she turned in 39 pairs of
 men’s socks­  — at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">the age of 99. Another, Mrs. Dorothy Russell was the leader of the group in 1990
 but had been a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">quilter since 1955, a service record of 35 years. Names of participants which
 might resonate with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">some Westminster families to this day were Ruby Storey, Emma McIvor, Eleanor
 Connolly, Alma </span>

 Esdale, Kay Flood, Carol </span>

        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:8483.91px;">IN WESTMINSTER UNITED CHURCH</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9083.50px;">1)Early in 1998 a sub-committee was created from our Outreach Committee with the
 mandate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9434.27px;">looking into refugee sponsorships. In the spring of 1998 I met with Despic
 Mladen and his wife at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9785.04px;">church. After discussion it was decided the church would look at sponsoring his
 cousin, Lela Saric </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10135.80px;">and her family to Winnipeg. Lela had a husband and 3 daughters. They were
 trapped in Sarajevo, </span>
