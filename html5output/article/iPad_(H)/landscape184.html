        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">This church is ALIVE! Attend as an observer at one of the 44 member Board
 meetings gathered </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">around a square and where the chairmen have done lots of homework in preparing
 their arguments  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">and briefs. This is not a ‘Yes Men’ organization. Matters of Westminster are thoroughly discussed and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">agreed upon.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">I welcomed the opportunity of the Newsletter Editor to write down a few thoughts
 of the past years. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">All these years have been a family team effort. My wife and I still enjoy our
 membership and are </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">happy to realize that our daughter, Marilyn, has taken up the reins.”</span>

        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:4616.26px;">Reverend Reid Vipond</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:5215.86px;">When our eighth minister, Reid Vipond, wrote his memoirs in 1992, chapter 15 was
 entitled Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:5566.62px;">Revisited (1963-1979). In this section of his book he gave us an incredibly
 detailed look at what and where </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:5917.39px;">we were as a congregation for those 16 years. For a man of 80 years of age his
 memory for detail was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:6268.15px;">amazing. We present the whole chapter here (7800 words!) with pleasure  and we thank </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:6618.92px;">Reid’s daughter, Mary, for sharing it with us.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7169.68px;">Reid writes:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7720.45px;">We so thoroughly enjoyed the British television version of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:8032.64px;top:7720.45px;">Brideshead Revisited</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:10627.01px;top:7720.45px;">, that I thought the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8071.21px;">heading ‘Westminster Revisited’ was at least somewhat appropriate for this chapter. We, too, found </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8421.98px;">ourselves reliving our earlier years, 1946–1949, often reminiscing with parishioners about the glory </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8772.74px;">days back in the forties when the church was packed every Sunday morning; when
 an average </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9123.50px;">Sunday evening service had an attendance of three or four hundred; when there
 were between 100 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9474.27px;">and 150 in the Apex Young People’s group; when I organized the junior youth group (mostly Grade 11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9825.04px;">and 12 young people) whose innovative programs were among the most imaginative I
 have ever seen. </span>
