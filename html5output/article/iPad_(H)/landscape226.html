        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">United Church Moderator.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1770.66px;">During Bob’s stay at Westminster he participated with lay people to develop Celebration </span>

 for more </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">informal, intergenerational services. They began with a mid-week service and
 latterly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">held services in the gymnasium of the church on Sundays at the same time as the

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4314.33px;">For Lorraine, the culmination of a long held dream began in March </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4665.09px;">and April 2005, when she went to Romania to look after orphan babies! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5215.86px;">Orphan babies, you say? Where did that come from? She never did talk about her
 motivation, but the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5566.62px;">answer seemed obvious. Almost all of her nursing career had been spent working
 in nurseries in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5917.39px;">Japan, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and for a short time in Vernon. She loved taking
 care of babies and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6268.15px;">developed a great skill in doing that.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6818.92px;">Romania, you say? Actually, this dream started for Lorraine with no thought of
 Romania. For ages, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7169.68px;">she had talked about going somewhere, where she could care for orphan babies — the obvious choice </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7520.45px;">seemed to be Africa, where Aids was causing so many orphans, but trying to find
 a place who would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7871.21px;">take volunteer workers for a short term became more of a challenge than you
 might have thought. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8421.98px;">The other obstacle had been, that she had been trying to enlist Bob on this new
 adventure, but with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8772.74px;">no idea of where she was going or for how long she would be there, Bob was
 reluctant. He had other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9123.50px;">thing he wanted to do with his retirement.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9674.27px;">Finally, at Christmas time in 2004, Lorraine made up her mind that 2005 was
 going to be the year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10025.04px;">and in a matter of a week or two, through a friend of a friend, she was given
