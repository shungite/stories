        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6117.39px;">For Lorraine, the culmination of a long held dream began in March </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6468.15px;">and April 2005, when she went to Romania to look after orphan babies! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7018.92px;">Orphan babies, you say? Where did that come from? She never did talk about her
 motivation, but the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7369.68px;">answer seemed obvious. Almost all of her nursing career had been spent working
 in nurseries in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7720.45px;">Japan, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and for a short time in Vernon. She loved taking
 care of babies and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8071.21px;">developed a great skill in doing that.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8621.98px;">Romania, you say? Actually, this dream started for Lorraine with no thought of
 Romania. For ages, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8972.74px;">she had talked about going somewhere, where she could care for orphan babies — the obvious choice </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9323.50px;">seemed to be Africa, where Aids was causing so many orphans, but trying to find
 a place who would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9674.27px;">take volunteer workers for a short term became more of a challenge than you
 might have thought. </span>
