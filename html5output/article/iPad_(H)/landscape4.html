        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The back hall of our church has always been a kind of picture gallery. There, we
 find a smattering </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">of old pictures of people identified as our church ‘Founders,’ some with undecipherable signatures </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">,and a row of larger pictures, many in colour, of our ‘Ministers.’ We used to also find another row, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">now removed, of dignified but cloudily photographed faces of our ‘Assistant Ministers.’ </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">I have always understood this collection as a kind of homage to those who have
 nurtured us, led us. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">But, for me, this gallery says more about the people who hung these pictures
 than their subjects. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">The ‘Founders’ section, for instance, is a rather puny sample of the 55 people recorded as
 composing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">the adventurers who struck out to create a new church. Why were these particular
 people chosen to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">represent the larger whole? Why is the church’s first Minister’s wife identified as a church founder, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">when in fact she and her husband were not among those who spearheaded its
 establishment? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Another somewhat subtle but telling detail: the differences in size among these
 profiles, seeming </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">to designate some men — and they are always men — as more noteworthy than others. The big men </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">and the little men. And no women. Where are the church’s women Assistant Ministers, Deaconesses, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">and Christian Education Directors? Today, we are more uneasy with such sexist
 omissions, as, I hope, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">we are more disposed to scrutinize the other elitisms that can influence the
 layout of something </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">so mundane, but representative, as a church’s hall of notables. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">One clear question, guiding my research and the spirit of this book, emerged
 from such scattered </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">thoughts: who, after all, were and are the real notables of the church,
 officially recognized as such </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">or otherwise? If on setting out on this project, I thought I could
 authoritatively answer this question, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">my research soon disabused me of such a conceit. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">It all began, as these things so often do, in an unassuming fashion. An
 assistant minster reminded </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">me that our church’s 125th anniversary was approaching, and a book would probably be published </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">to acknowledge the event. Why didn’t I contribute a single article to that book, he asked? I dutifully </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">did so, discussing major themes in Minister Bonnell’s theological thinking as captured in his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">sermons at Westminster and at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian in New York. Before I
 knew it, I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">researching to write a biography of Bonnell and Westminster’s other three founding ministers: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">Pitblado, MacKinnon, Christie and Bonnell. Like so many hobbyist historians, my
 goal was not </span>
