        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">in a rented hall. Because the building was used for other purposes during the
 week, Bob’s car trunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">became the storage area for the pulpit, the church library and tapes with the
 hymns and speakers to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">play them through. Each Sunday’s worship was preceded by a rapid few moments of furniture </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">moving! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">At Christmas, 1975, Bob was called to St. Andrews-Wesley in Vancouver* as an
 assistant minister </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">responsible for Outreach and Christian Education. During his one year furlough
 from Japan, he had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">worked there while taking training in high-rise apartment ministry.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">And now the Thompsons have come to the Prairies with their three children;
 Jillian-11, Amanda-5, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">and Joshua who arrived on July 19th adding a further challenge to the already
 horrendous task of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">moving from Vancouver to Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">The official induction of the Rev. Robert Thompson as our minister will take
 place in our Church on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">Sunday, October 14 at 7:30 PM with members of Presbytery officiating.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-29.49px;top:4976.77px;">*More recently St Andrews-Wesley has been the home church of Rev. Gary Paterson,
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">United Church Moderator.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5878.30px;">During Bob’s stay at Westminster he participated with lay people to develop Celebration </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6229.07px;">Worship using contemporary and traditional music and various forms of Liturgy
 for more </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6579.83px;">informal, intergenerational services. They began with a mid-week service and
 latterly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">held services in the gymnasium of the church on Sundays at the same time as the
 traditional service </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8421.98px;">For Lorraine, the culmination of a long held dream began in March </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8772.74px;">and April 2005, when she went to Romania to look after orphan babies! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9323.50px;">Orphan babies, you say? Where did that come from? She never did talk about her
 motivation, but the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9674.27px;">answer seemed obvious. Almost all of her nursing career had been spent working
 in nurseries in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10025.04px;">Japan, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and for a short time in Vernon. She loved taking
