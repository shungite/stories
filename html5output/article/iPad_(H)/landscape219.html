 became the proud </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">parents of David (August 15, 1974) and Beth (December 22, 1976.) Fran has been
 extremely active in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">church and community work as well as being available for substitute teaching.
 Even more important </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">for Dorothy and me personally, Fran keeps in close touch with our “going out” and our “coming in.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">She checks our house and our mail and does our banking when we are away. Without
 her assistance, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">we would not be able to do our worry-free travelling. Besides being head of
 history at Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">Secondary School now, Don is also available for chores at 406 Wortley that are
 too heavy for an </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Doug did his BA at the University of Winnipeg, and by dint of his work for
 several summers on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">university farm, went to York in 1970. He completed his PhD in psychology, and,
 following a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">postdoctoral year at Boulder, Colorado, joined the staff of St. Thomas
 University in Fredericton. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">and Jane Bowden were married in the chapel of Westminster in Winnipeg on August
 25, 1972. Jane is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">from Winnipeg, a graduate of U of T in early childhood education and from the
 Toronto Royal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Conservatory as a clarinetist and now has a large clarinet class. They, too, are
 proud parents—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">Nicholas, May 24, 1979, and Samuel, October 18, 1983.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Rob finished Grade 12 at Kelvin in Winnipeg in 1971 and enrolled at U of T in
 political science. His </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">summer employment was in Winnipeg in government-sponsored educational projects.
 After </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">graduation in 1975, he spent a year in Geneva at the Graduate Institute of
 International Affairs, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">returned to Toronto to do an MA, then to Harvard to study government. He joined
 the U of T political </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">science department in 1981 and completed his PhD about two years later. He met
 Gina Feldberg at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Harvard, and they were married on June 26, 1983 at Harvard Chapel. Gina has
 since completed her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">PhD in the history of medicine, and is on staff at York University in Toronto.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">I had the joy of performing all four weddings—in London, Winnipeg, Montreal, and Boston. Why not? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">Someone asked Doug who was going to conduct his wedding. “My dad, of course. When you’ve got a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">minister in the family, why pay five bucks to bring someone else in?” Indeed so!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">In the spring of 1978, I told the board at Westminster that I would be retiring
 in June 1979. After the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">summer, a pastoral relations committee was formed, but didn’t become very active until early 1979. </span>
