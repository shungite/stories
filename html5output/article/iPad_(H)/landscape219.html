        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">a Sunday school picture book done by all the Sunday school kids; a Yashica
 camera from the board; a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">choir picture, and lots of lighthearted music from the choir; music from some of
 the Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Chamber Orchestra, with a card signed by all the orchestra members; and finally,
 for us, a cheque for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">$6,000 from the congregation. What a night! During the supper hour, members of
 the planning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">committee took Dorothy and me to every table, stopping just long enough to say
 hello. It was a thrill </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">to be able to call practically every individual person by name—one advantage of a long pastorate.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">The next day we went down to Encore Travel and booked a three-week tour to
 Greece for September. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">It was a great finale to a fabulous sixteen years—actually sixteen years plus the three years as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">assistant. There were only two more weeks to go, and the days and nights were
 filled with luncheons </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">and dinner parties hosted by so many kind folk. We completed plans to rent our
 house to Dr. Brian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Bevan, a middle-aged English doctor who was soon to bring his bride to Canada,
 and they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">happy to rent a completely furnished house for nine months while they decided
 where they might </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">wish to build or buy. We spent a few days packing all our clothes from clothes
 closets and bedroom </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">drawers, plus all my books and files from the vestry—a grand total of thirty boxes to be stored in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">furnace room! Everything else was left “as is”—bedding, dishes, pictures on the walls, etc. At $375 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">per month, we think the Bevans had a good deal. We trusted that they would look
 after things well, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">and we found out when we came home on April 30, 1980, that everything was in
 good order.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">The pulpit supply committee had arranged for Sunday services for July 1979, but
 since we were in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">town, I had offered to take funerals and weddings, and it turned out to be one
 of those very busy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">months. But I was not about to leave people scrambling to find someone to
 conduct a funeral, or to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">have a stranger for their wedding when we were in the city anyway. So it worked
 out okay.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">As an appendix to this chapter I shall include my second-last sermon at
 Westminster, which I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">entitled, “The First Forty Years are the Hardest.” There will not be much overlapping with what has </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">been written thus far, but perhaps it gives a kind of summary. (Let me confess
 here that ten years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">later, in 1989, when I was completing my second post-retirement job, at
 Metropolitan in London, I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">used almost exactly the same sermon, simply changing the title to “The First Fifty Years are the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">Hardest.”)</span>
