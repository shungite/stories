        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">answer seemed obvious. Almost all of her nursing career had been spent working
 in nurseries in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Japan, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and for a short time in Vernon. She loved taking
 care of babies and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">developed a great skill in doing that.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Romania, you say? Actually, this dream started for Lorraine with no thought of
 Romania. For ages, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">she had talked about going somewhere, where she could care for orphan babies — the obvious choice </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">seemed to be Africa, where Aids was causing so many orphans, but trying to find
 a place who would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">take volunteer workers for a short term became more of a challenge than you
 might have thought. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">The other obstacle had been, that she had been trying to enlist Bob on this new
 adventure, but with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">no idea of where she was going or for how long she would be there, Bob was
 reluctant. He had other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">thing he wanted to do with his retirement.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">Finally, at Christmas time in 2004, Lorraine made up her mind that 2005 was
 going to be the year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">and in a matter of a week or two, through a friend of a friend, she was given
 the name of Dwight </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">DeLong, an American who has started a foundation in Romania for caring for
 orphans. She emailed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">him and asked if he had any volunteer work for a 59 year old woman who just
 wanted to cuddle </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">babies. He said come ahead, and that she did. Another woman from the church
 asked if she could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">join the expedition, and plans moved so quickly for the two of them, that
 Lorraine’s passport arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">on a Friday, just in time for her Monday departure. She flew from Kelowna to
 Vancouver to Frankfurt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">to Budapest in Hungary, where she was picked up by a van, and driven just three
 hours, over the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Romanian border to Oradea. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">When Lorraine and Betty arrived in Oradea, they discovered that, in fact, caring
 for babies under 2 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">years of age, was a new undertaking for the Foundation, and much of the two
 months they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">there, was spent orienting the Romanian workers to this new undertaking. They
 worked on a floor of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">the children’s hospital in Oradea which housed babies up to the age of two years. The great
 majority </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">of these babies had been born to Roma (gypsy) parents. The Roma custom is for
 the women to marry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">very young, and so they have large families, born into extreme poverty. The work
 of the foundation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">was to help the babies develop socially and physically so that they were healthy
 in more than a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">medical sense, as they moved back home, or into foster homes, and they had some
 degree of success. </span>
