        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">working mothers. After a year of planning, getting the program officially
 recognized by the provincial </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">government, and with funding in place by the church, the government and the
 mothers, the project </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">began. Major funding was eventually picked up by the government, with the church
 supplying all the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">facilities and the volunteers. We began with one staff person and twenty-five or
 so children. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">program has grown, and for many years has had two workers and forty to fifty
 children. A large </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">group of volunteers assist at meal time. All equipment has been upgraded to
 fulfill the Board of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">Health requirements. Members of the congregation carry most of the
 responsibility for the work of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">the child care board. It is such a well-established program that one couldn’t imagine Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">without it.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">The church sanctuary, halls, and meeting rooms are used by many groups in the
 city. The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Chamber Orchestra has its four or five concerts each year in the sanctuary, and
 the orchestra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">members use most of the facilities for rehearsing. At times, it was somewhat a
 nuisance, but this was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">offset for me by the personal joy to give over my vestry to many guest artists.
 I remember best of all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Liona Boyd, Ivan Moravec, Elmer Iseler, and the Canadian Brass.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Several high schools still have their June graduations in the sanctuary. Mrs.
 Litz’s Mennonite </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Children’s Choir made several of their records in our church. The Winnipeg Ladies Choir,
 mainly a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">Mennonite choir, also used the sanctuary. The acoustics are excellent, and even
 more important, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">welcome mat was always out.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Many other community groups use the excellent facilities at Westminster. At
 election time, we had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">all-candidates’ meetings. Several organizations, such as the Peace Action Committee, use space
 on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">our third-floor meeting hall (called the concert hall after the stage was
 erected in the early seventies). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">For a number of years, the gym was used each Sunday afternoon for recreation and
 refreshments for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">ex-psychiatric patients, men and women, who used to be at the Selkirk Mental
 Hospital, but who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8712.67px;">were now living in the community. The program “Mothers</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-60" style="left:8007.75px;top:8689.29px;">ʼ</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8070.05px;top:8712.67px;"> Morning Off” is still going strong. And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9109.37px;">again, the list goes on.</span>
