        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">on the life and work of the congregation. Suffice it to say that in the midst of
 all the programs and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">special events that we have touched on in these last dozen pages, my own time
 was naturally taken </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">up most of all with Sunday worship and pastoral care. There were many demands on
 one’s time: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">hospital visiting, as much home visiting as it was humanly possible to do,
 funerals, weddings, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">counselling, many long days and many late nights. We were blessed with very
 dedicated and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">competent staff associates, and a vast array of just as dedicated and competent
 lay workers. As </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">pointed out earlier, the new board structure made it very easy to bring new
 people into active </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">participation. The nominating committee was always eager to have new names
 passed on to them, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">and in my pastoral visiting. I kept an eye open for any likely candidate for a
 spot on the General </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">Board. These were great years, and retirement age closed in all too quickly.
 But, as someone </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">commented at our retirement party, the term should not be “re-tired,” but merely “re-treaded” for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3826.01px;">future work. It certainly turned out that way!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">Perhaps a brief review of our own family should be given here, for during this
 sixteen-year tenure at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Westminster, many things had happened.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Miss Marion Forbes had been with us since 1950, moving along as part of our
 family and household </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">from Edmonton to Regina to Winnipeg. But, the time came when she didn’t want to be alone in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">house when we were away, and in 1968, with Fran’s wedding in London in the offing, she moved into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">the very fine (and new) Fred Douglas Lodge. We were always in close touch with
 her, and she was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">back to the house for special events, as her health permitted. Following an
 attack of pneumonia in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">the summer of 1970, she had to be moved to a nursing home for a month or two. I
 was with her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">when she died peacefully on October 2, 1970. She had been an important part of
 our whole family, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">and we were always grateful that our home could be her home for twenty years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">During the late sixties, Dorothy interspersed many church activities with the
 completion of five </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">courses at the University of Manitoba. That gave her the qualifications to be a
 teacher-librarian, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">from 1969–1979, first part-time, then full-time, she was on the Laura Secord Elementary
 School staff. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">With an honours BA from Queen’s, a BEd from the University of Alberta, and the library course at U </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">of M, she well merited a special Dorothy Vipond retirement party at Laura
 Secord.</span>
