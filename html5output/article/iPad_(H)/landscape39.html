 recommended that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Margaret not attempt the voyage home to Prince Edward Island, where the family
 now lived, on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">account of her frayed “nerves”. Whether or not this recommendation, which smacks of the sexism </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">underlying much of Victorian medicine, was medically sound, Margaret had surely
 earned the right </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">to stay in her native home. At any rate, she refused to return to PEI. John, now
 a minister of a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Presbyterian church in Georgetown, soon resigned and moved with the rest of the
 family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">to Scotland. Clarence was 15 at this point.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">By the time he was 22, his father had died and he and his two brothers, George
 and Albert, were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:1240.96px;top:2973.72px;">attending the University of Edinburgh. The only general degree courses available
 at that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:1799.62px;top:3324.48px;">time were Greek, Latin, mathematics, philosophy, English, physics, and moral </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2053.82px;top:3675.25px;">philosophy. In 1889, now 23, Clarence pursued a Master’s in theology. Like Charles </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2181.36px;top:4026.01px;">Pitblado, he was an enthusiastic learner, but his intellectual interests ran in
 more </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2219.99px;top:4376.77px;">eclectic directions. He’d already won several prizes in mathematics, and was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2216.08px;top:4727.54px;">admitted as a Master’s student upon winning the University’s second highest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2155.58px;top:5078.30px;">scholarship. Rebelling against the received opinion of the Christian
 establishment </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:1994.81px;top:5429.07px;">of his day, Clarence explored an interest in evolutionary theory, whose most
 famous </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:1688.78px;top:5779.83px;">pioneer, Charles Darwin, was also an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh.
 Reflecting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">upon his early studies, which unfolded in a period when Britain’s leading institutions of higher </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">learning were being steadily infiltrated by Darwin’s revolutionary ideas, Clarence writes:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:438.49px;top:7032.13px;">“I can still recall the thrill of delight when I first learned how life was made
 up of individual cells </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7382.89px;">that had developed and become diversified into so many organisms … Up to that time however I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7733.66px;">had been too well instructed to lend a ready ear to Evolution, indeed had fought
 it in the mind…”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">This defiance was undone by his curiosity, which led to study. Exploiting the
 exceptional intellectual </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">environment of the University of Edinburgh — which, in addition to schooling Darwin, was a vital </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">organ of the Scottish Enlightenment — Clarence’s “hesitating feet” were drawn from the seminary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">to the natural history classroom. While initially resisting “with a mysterious sense of dread” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">the ideas expounded in the first two lectures he attended on evolution, by the
 third lecture, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">on embryology, he “succumbed:”</span>
