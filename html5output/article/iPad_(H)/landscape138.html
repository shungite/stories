        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:6239.94px;top:1219.89px;">Allen and Mildred had a life beyond Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:6239.94px;top:1570.66px;">Church. They were part of an active community </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:6239.94px;top:1921.42px;">of other ministers and their wives. Allen was active </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:6239.94px;top:2272.19px;">in ‘ministerial politics’ meaning Presbytery and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:6239.94px;top:2622.95px;">Conference. Those were the years when Rev. Fred </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Douglas led the church extension program, which Allen did not appreciate because
 he believed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">it would be harmful to the existing downtown churches like Knox, Young,
 Augustine, Grace, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Fort Rouge and Westminster. Allen was right. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Allen was not a one dimensional person. He was a vigorous community-minded
 person. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">He constructed a small rink on the lawn between the manse and the church, for
 use by kids in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">neighbourhood. During the famous flood of 1950 he enlisted for sand-bagging
 duties to save the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">newly constructed Shaarey Zedek Synagogue from serious damage. He enjoyed
 bowling, curling and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">golf. Well … golf was an athletic endeavour that he never mastered, and drove him to
 distraction. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">was a member of a service club, and a Masonic Lodge. He enjoyed playing bridge.
 He did all these </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">things with the same intensity he brought to his professional responsibilities. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Allen and Mildred were introduced to Kenora and environs by church members with
 cottage </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">properties on Mackie Island on Lake of the Woods, near Keewatin. Allen acquired
 a lot on the east </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">side of the island, and helped construct a lovely cottage that became a focal
 point in the lives of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">entire family. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Allen Huband’s tenure at Westminster was about 8 years, before moving on to Kingsway Lambton </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">Church in Toronto. Those 8 years were formative years for our family members.
 Rolph had completed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">his degree in Commerce, had gone on to also graduate in law, and had begun a
 career in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">secretariat of the Hudson Bay Company. (He subsequently moved to Toronto with
 the Bay, becoming </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">corporate secretary and vice president of the corporation before his
 retirement.) Mary had become an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10238.25px;">elementary school teacher, soon to be married, and moved to Toronto and later
 Ottawa, where she </span>
