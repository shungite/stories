        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">at the age of 99! Another, Mrs. Dorothy Russell was the leader of the group in
 1990 but has been a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">quilter since 1955, a service record of 35 years. Names of participants which
 might resonate with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">some Westminster familieQuilters 1 copys to this day were Ruby Storey, Emma
 McIvor, Eleanor </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Flood, Carol McBride, Marjorie Robers, Winnie Christie, Sonia Wright and more
 recently Grace Aoki. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">I encourage all of you to take a look at the quilts framed and hanging in the
 washrooms at the back </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">of the Church. The larger piece is The Lorna Waddington Quilt, and dates from
 the 1930’s, a gift at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">that time to Lorna (Esdale) Waddington. Lorna passed it on to the women of the
 Westminster United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Church Quilting group who used these antique pieced blocks to create a quilt to
 hang in the narthex </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">of the Church. The quilt was hung on Thursday, January 18, 2007.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">In 1978, the United Church’s new Division of Mission in Canada (DMC) initiated a study into the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">UCWs across Canada who were struggling with the structure set in 1962 and with
 other issues. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">study recommended that it would be beneficial for Conference presidents to meet
 regularly to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">discuss issues, concerns, and projects. The gathering was to be called a
 consultation, with no </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">administrative or decision-making authority but Conference presidents continued
 to meet for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">years. In 2000, at the General Council meeting, a resolution was passed stating
 that “all women’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">groups within the Pastoral Charge or congregation are free to determine their
 size, structure, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">manner of leadership.” At the 2003 General Council meeting, The Women’s Ministries Network was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">proposed and adopted. It would encompass the UCW, the only structured group, and
 all other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">women’s groups within the United Church. In 2003, the name National Consultation of
 United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Church Women was changed to National United Church Women (NUCW).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">What we see today is women continuing to be strong contributors to the work of
 Westminster, but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">now, not so much as a separate entity, but full partners, on the board, on
 committees, as staff, as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">volunteers and as ministers. I found a write up done by Lorna Harvey on Yvonne
 Whitehead, done in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">1984 that describes one woman’s role in the change. Yvonne transferred from Knox to Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">in 1955. She joined Unit 13 and the J.S. Bonnell Mission. She was the last
 president of UCW before </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">Westminster Church went to the General Board format. Prior to the end of her
 term she was on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">committee which drew up the guide lines for the General Board. As chair of the
 Membership and </span>
