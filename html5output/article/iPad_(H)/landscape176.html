        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Joan picked me up and WAS a lovely lady. I remember thinking that if the rest of
 the group was this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">nice, great, the evening would be fine. The evening was fun, chatting with women
 in the same boat </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">as me. Trying to live a Christian life while raising kids and dealing with life’s adventures.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">It wasn’t that long before we (as a group) decided to look after the nursery Sunday
 school, thusly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">meeting more of our Church members and becoming involved. I have a clear memory
 of making </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:1921.42px;">‘fancy’ sandwiches at Lorrie’s house for the Annual Fall Bazaar (maybe it was the spring tea) and that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">skill has served me well through the years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">As a group we were definitely each other’s significant others when the need arose. This has proven </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">true to this day. We are so lucky. But mostly I remember having fun. Dinners
 with the Husbands </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">(once again at Lorrie’s house — she had the largest home at the time or was the first to volunteer to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">host). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">I truly believe that because of Unit I, became more involved with WUC. We all
 did. We welcomed new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">members to our group and said goodbye to others. We chose studies that were
 relevant to our lives </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">and shared thoughts and feelings this way.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">Unit 10, too, is still going strong, celebrating their 50 year mark as a unit
 within the church, Phyllis </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">Reader reports. They are going to the Temple Gardens Spa in Moose Jaw to
 celebrate this auspicious </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">occasion at the end of the month! Unit 10 meets once a month during the winter
 months and has a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">special dinner at Christmas and spring. Liz Witjkamp, Rita Menzies, Val
 McIntyre, Lynn Heise and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Ann Peeler have been members since the beginning. Phyllis goes on to say the
 group “was a great </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">support, as members went through the various stages of life, career changes,
 raising kids, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">grandchildren, weddings, funerals and parents passing away. We did our share of
 teas and helping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">with after church luncheons, garage sales, and contributions of home baking for
 a host of events. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">We've been through it all and have developed very strong, loyal relationships
 over the years. We met </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">in members homes once a month. Discussed church business and all of us have
 served on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">various committees and the church board. In fact they are now recycling us
 again.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">Women were part of many activities of the Church, singing in the Choir, teaching
 Sunday School and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">leading youth groups, such as Canadian Girls in Training. </span>
