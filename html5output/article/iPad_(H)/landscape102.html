        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">In 1916 the family made its next move across the Bonaventure Bay to Wesleyville.
  After three years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">living there Ernest completed as much education as he could get in an Outport
 School and headed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">off to the Methodist College in St. John’s as his father and his older sisters had. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:1219.89px;">For one last reference to Outport life I look at Ernest’s last year </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:1570.66px;">at home before setting off for college. During the summer, to earn </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:1921.42px;">money to help pay his tuition he joined a neighbour of the family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:2272.19px;">named Bill. Bill was a fisherman who enjoyed “handlining.” This </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:2622.95px;">technique employed a line outfitted with a single hook baited with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:2973.72px;">clams and such. Familiar to most of us. But handlining could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:3324.48px;">sometime turn into “jigging.” This variation had two unbated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:3675.25px;">hooks and a lead sinker, shaped as a fish at the end. The lead </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:4026.01px;">would pull the line to the bottom. Then the line would be pulled </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:4682.70px;top:4376.77px;">up slightly and jigged up and down to snag passing cod.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">The money Ernest earned that last summer was paid, by Bill, to his parents and
 salted away for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Methodist College tuition. By the end of his 16th summer he said goodbye to his
 family and brought </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">to a close an epoch in his life. On he went, 16 years of age, to St. John’s and the world.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-19" style="top:6212.24px;">Leaving Home For Schooling</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:6763.83px;">“Many times before that morning on the steamer (sailing into St.Johns harbour) I
 had been given to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7114.60px;">puzzled meditation about the strangeness of our existence, the mystery of our
 own little being in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7465.36px;">infinity of the universe.” Ernest was conscious of the small settlements in which he had spent the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7816.13px;">entirety of his life. On the one hand he recognized how little they had and yet,
 as he says several </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8166.89px;">times in his autobiography, he never felt “poor”. Then, too, there was the immense sea, and men </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8517.66px;">working their small boats to wrest a living from it. And the women who waited at
 home; waiting and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8868.42px;">waiting; lives tenuous and vulnerable.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9419.19px;">St.John’s was his first life experience with a city. “I had grown up, not only with no radio and no </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9769.95px;">TV — no one else had them — but I had never spoken over a telephone, I had never turned on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10120.72px;">electric light, I had never lived in a house with running water and I had never
 ridden in an </span>
