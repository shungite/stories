        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Phil began a life of travel, revisiting countries where he had served in WWII.
 He had been a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">patient, caring, and long-serving husband.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Pat Hodges arrived in Winnipeg with her husband, Houston, just as the search
 committee was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">looking for a new church secretary. Houston was a United  Methodist minister from Texas, and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">come to be the social action secretary of Winnipeg presbytery. Joan McConnell
 met the Hodges, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">discovered that Pat had been a church secretary in the deep south and was hoping
 to get </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">employment in Winnipeg. It was a perfect fit, and for our last two years at
 Westminster, the phone </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">was answered with a happy and cheery southern drawl.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">For many years, indeed, from its beginning in 1892, Westminster had a Session
 and a Deacon’s Court. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">The Deacon’s Court was something like an official board in that it consisted of all members
 of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Session, plus people who were on the finance and property committee. There was
 no Committee of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Stewards; this function was performed by the Deacon’s Court.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Somewhere in Dr. Allen Huband’s tenure (1948–1955), the decision was made to follow the United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">Church Manual which called for a Session, a Committee of Stewards, and an
 Official Board. In general </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">terms, the Session has oversight over things spiritual, the Stewards over things
 temporal, and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Official Board is a combination of these two (plus presidents of all
 organizations). Also, it has the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">power to act on behalf of the congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">But there has always been a problem here. Why should we divide the spiritual and
 the temporal? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Aren’t they all of a piece, really? Why should one particular group (the Stewards) do
 all the property </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">work, and even more especially, all the financial decisions? Granted, all
 decisions are supposed to be </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">checked by the Official Board, but this is usually only rubber-stamping. Also,
 it makes difficult </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">communication within a church. Despite the Good Book to the contrary, the left
 hand should know </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">what the right is doing!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">Another problem with the board structure at Westminster (common in many
 churches) was that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">there seemed to be no terminal point for many office holders. For example, when
 we went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">Westminster in 1963, the same man had been clerk of Session for a dozen years or
 more and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">same person had held the position as chairman of Stewards for ten years. Also,
 there were only three </span>
