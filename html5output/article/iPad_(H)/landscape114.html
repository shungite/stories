        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">We (Howse) took stands on daily issues, local, provincial, national and
 international. He was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">expected to give addresses to clubs and lodges, and hold membership in boards
 and societies.  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">And he did have a family. Esther and Margaret were soon joined by David and
 George, both born in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Winnipeg. He mentions in his book, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:5016.21px;top:1219.89px;">Roses in December</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:7357.11px;top:1219.89px;">, a two month holiday with pay in the summer…</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">.For me that was a life preserver … a time to do extra reading and writing. My years were marked not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">from January to January but from vacation to vacation. At the end of January I
 was “half way to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">lake.” (A phrase he found peculiar to Winnipegers apparently — elsewhere in Canada people go to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">cottage — we normally go to the lake. Or so says Ernest.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">I am closing off this essay at this point. The number of political and social
 issues in which Ernest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Marshall Howse was involved was considerable and deserves separate articles to
 cover some of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">details. Some of these activities impinged directly on Westminster. Other
 involved only Howse as a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">lone public figure. As such he was both praised and damned. That comes of taking
 stands on issues. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">Howse loved issues. He was never quiet where he felt his voice needed to be
 heard.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:5127.54px;">Article by R. Halstead- with thanks for those items more or less directly
 borrowed from Roses in December.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:5668.56px;">Ernest Marshall Howse vs Government</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6268.15px;">During his time with us, particularly during the period (1939-45) of WW II, and
 earlier, Howse became </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6618.92px;">known as a small L ‘liberal,’ a voice against bad government, and against causes which were unfair or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6969.68px;">damaging to various groups of people. His reputation in this regard was
 recognized, not only in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7320.45px;">Winnipeg, but more generally across the whole of Canada. In another article in
 this series we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7671.21px;">mention one of his major issues with Government:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:8221.98px;">“One cause to which I was ardently committed was the struggle to shift the
 Canadian Government to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">a more humane policy on refugees — particularly the Jewish refugees fleeing from the monstrous </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">cruelty of the Nazis.” The article is called </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:5712.38px;top:8923.50px;">Antisemitism</span>
