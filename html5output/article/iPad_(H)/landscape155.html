        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">In his ‘private’ life Herb was company Secretary for Robinson, Little Company, founded in 1875
 in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">London, Ontario. The company began operating department stores in Eastern Canada
 and, having </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">expanded into Western Canada as the ‘big chain of little department stores,’ operated over 180 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Robinson Stores by 1970. How Herb managed his business life and his musical life
 is somewhat of a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">mystery. He wasn’t married. That might have helped.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Finally, in 1955, lung cancer carried Herb Sadler off. Herb loved to smoke. Half
 way through church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">choir practices a 15 minute recess was always declared. The men of the choir
 retired to the large </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">men’s washroom in the basement of the church for a “spit and a puff.” (Herb’s phrase.) There we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">would smoke, toss pennies against the wall and, of course, answer nature’s call. A bonding time for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">the men. But Herb’s ultimate undoing.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">No question, Herb was loved and respected by all who served under him. He was an
 Anglican — he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">would have us point the Psalms during rehearsals, purely as an exercise and for
 our interest. He was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">an Anglican — he had a couple of us, when in our teens dress in white robes and light candles
 on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">platform before weddings. He was an Anglican — much of our repertoire came from the pens of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">English (Brit) composers.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">He was a gentle man with gentle wit (“All I can see is a front row of heaving bosoms,” he would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">declare as a message that the rest of us should work as hard as the sopranos.).
 He was a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">talented organist. After evening service some of the younger of the choir would
 hang about asking </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">him to do mini recitals for us. He was a demanding choir director expecting and
 getting the very best </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">from every singer in his choir. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">The writer knew him for only four and a half years before his death but
 treasures, to this day, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">talent and humanity of Herb Sadler.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">(R.H.)</span>
