        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">leader. She and Murray were active in the 50/50 Club. For many years she was a
 leader of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">afternoon church circle. She was involved in the big Westminster church teas,
 held the first </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Wednesday of May, contributing baking. Onnumber of these, she was the convener
 for the tea. She </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">was the chair of the Fellowship committee for many years. People described
 Bonnie as considerate, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">elegant, caring and friendly – and as Georgine says, Westminster was part of her life. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">There are many in our recent history that have been in the forefront of
 leadership in Westminster — </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">we continue to remember Betty Halstead and her support of Refugees. There is
 record by a refugee of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Betty’s work — “Betty Halstead was in the heart of our efforts. Hers were the most difficult
 tasks, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">she did them with great joy and enthusiasm. Betty was a true leader, with always
 positive approach, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">giving encouragement when needed, taking initiative when needed, breaking
 through cultural </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">differences when needed.” There is also a choral scholarship in Betty’s name here at Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">And the work of Phyllis Reader and International Hope. Phyllis has worked
 tirelessly to collect and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">distribute surplus medical supplies to developing countries from Manitoba
 sources.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">And Christine McKee who Tom Carter, former Institute of Urban Studies
 (University of Winnipeg) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">Director and Canada Research Chair in Urban Change &amp; Adaptation, shared his admiration for McKee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">by way of written message. “Christine understood cities and she was a strong advocate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">comprehensive planning and revitalization of the inner city. She was also a very
 strong advocate for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">the more marginalized in society. Her tireless work for better quality of life
 for those in the inner city </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">was part of her strong commitment to planning equity.” She was an impetus for the Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Housing Foundation and the work that continues today to provide adequate housing
 for families in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">the area around this church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Another to mention, was Lorraine Sweatman. She and Alan were frequent attendees
 of the Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">church Service, and Dick and I regularly shared comments with them about the
 sermon. She served </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">on many committees and was chair of the board. I found this note, actually in
 Isabel Auld’s papers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">acknowledging the work she had done organizing a fellowship and fashion, in
 1988, which generated </span>
