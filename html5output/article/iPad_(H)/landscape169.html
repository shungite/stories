        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">it. I’ve tried to keep this to under 20 minutes, but have a longer paper that can be
 available to those </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">interested. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">First a brief history. It was in the fall of 1892 when eighteen members of St.
 Andrew’s Presbyterian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Church discussed the possibility of forming a more centrally located
 congregation for the growing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">community. Permission was granted and the work of establishing a new church
 began: its first </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">service was held on 1 January 1893 in Victoria Hall, later the Winnipeg Theatre,
 on Notre Dame </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Avenue, attended by more than 200 people. A few days later, the new congregation
 chose the name </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:2622.95px;">“Westminster” and construction of the permanent church at Notre Dame Avenue and Charlotte
 Street </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">commenced. First services were held in the new church on 31 December 1893.
 Formal dedication </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">services followed on 5 and 12 August 1894. By this time a women’s foreign mission society was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">active. In the early years of World War I Westminster was active in several
 fields: three missionaries </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">were posted in China and India, a club was formed for young women contemplating
 missionary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">work, and a social-recreational centre served more than 3,000 service people
 away from home in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">1914 alone. This all was happening before Union, and much of it before women
 even had the vote. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Churches were social centres, and, by looking at the parish histories of some
 churches, we can </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">reconstruct how they filled this role. Clarence McKinnon, the minister of
 Westminster Church when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">it was located on Notre Dame and Hargrave, recalled:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:6530.60px;">“Large after meetings were held on Sunday night. The social side of life was
 vigorously organized. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Newcomers were met and welcomed. Picnics, socials followed each other in quick
 succession. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Interchurch debates enlivened the winter months, and athletic sports in the
 summer. In my first year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">a gentleman, a French Canadian, stopped me on the street to tell me how, when he
 and his wife were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">lonely on their first arrival in the city, they had strayed into Westminster
 Church on a Sunday evening </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">and how grateful they were for the happy human fellowship they found there.
