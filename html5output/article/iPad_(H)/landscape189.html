        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:2271.67px;">IN WESTMINSTER UNITED CHURCH</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2871.27px;">1)Early in 1998 a sub-committee was created from our Outreach Committee with the
 mandate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3222.03px;">looking into refugee sponsorships. In the spring of 1998 I met with Despic
 Mladen and his wife at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3572.80px;">church. After discussion it was decided the church would look at sponsoring his
 cousin, Lela Saric </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3923.56px;">and her family to Winnipeg. Lela had a husband and 3 daughters. They were
 trapped in Sarajevo, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4274.33px;">Yugoslavia during the civil war in that country.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4825.09px;">After discussion with the Outreach Committee and the Board of the Church a
 motion was put forth to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5175.86px;">sponsor this family. A letter was sent the United Church head office in Toronto.
 On April 21, 1998 a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5526.62px;">Letter of Approval was received from the United Church. It was forwarded to
 Immigration Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5877.39px;">On Sept. 3, 1999 a letter was received from Citizenship and Immigration that
 they had been approved </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6228.15px;">and would be arriving in Winnipeg on Sept.21, 1999. This was a happy day. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6778.92px;">Lela, her husband, Zeljko and daughters, Violeta, Jovana and Danijela arrived
 safely and were greeted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7129.68px;">with family members.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7680.45px;">With Betty Halsteadâ€™s efforts of fund raising we raised over $10,000.00. There was a lot of interest
 and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8031.21px;">support from the congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8581.98px;">This family has remained in Winnipeg and became employed with all the girls
 receiving their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8932.74px;">education here in the city. This was a successful sponsorship.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9483.50px;">2) I received a letter in the church office on April 2, 2000 from an Allahyar
 Raza. I interviewed him </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9834.27px;">and his request from the church was to sponsor his brother, Khalil Raza who was
 a teenager trapped </span>
