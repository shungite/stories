        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">church.” There were 1172 visits made to patients in hospitals. And the total givings
 amounted to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">$1,673.21. In 1925, at the time of Union, it is noted about one quarter of the
 missionary work of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">United Church was supported by the women of the Women’s Missionary Society</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">The records show that in 1928, the Women’s Auxiliary of Westminster had a membership of 78, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">contributed $1,800 to the work of The Women’s Missionary Society. There were 32 in the Mission </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Band that year, that contributed $200.00. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">I wanted to share this motto of the Women’s Missionary Society from those early years: “The World </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">for Christ Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.
 Whatsoever He saith </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">unto you, do it.” It was the ‘Do It’ that spoke to me, and continues to speak to Westminster women.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">I’d like to share with you a bit about what the work of the Women’s Auxiliary supported. This is from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">a 1928 report by a Dr. Caroline Macdonald, who did “Prison Work” — these early women who did </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">home missions were called deaconesses, the early beginnings of the diaconal
 ministry we have today. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Dr. Macdonald states: “Statistics may be very uninteresting, but can sometimes be very instructive. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">You will remember that the grant I am receiving from the United Church of Canada
 is $2,500 a year. I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">have just finished making out the half yearly statement of how the money has
 been used and I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">curious myself to see what information statistics alone would bring forth.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">Here they are: with about $620. We have sent 1,406 books to 326 men in prison.
 With less than $700, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">we have given the equivalent of one night’s lodging to about 1,474 men or an average of 4 men for an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">entire year, as well as other financial help to 202 others. The number of
 letters received from men in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">prison was 679 and number sent 907, while 1,420 ex prisoners have been given
 advice about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">everything under the sun, including things spiritual and mundane. We have sent
 men home to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">country when they have wanted to go, we have bought clothes for them when they
 were needed, we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">have set them up in business. We have mended family quarrels, we have brought
 wives as well as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">men back to a sense of duty, we have stayed awake nights thinking of those who
 have gone astray </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">again, and we have stopped at nothing if by all means we might save some.”</span>
