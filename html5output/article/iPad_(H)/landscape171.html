        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">were posted in China and India, a club was formed for young women contemplating
 missionary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">work, and a social-recreational centre served more than 3,000 service people
 away from home in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">1914 alone. This all was happening before Union, and much of it before women
 even had the vote. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Churches were social centres, and, by looking at the parish histories of some
 churches, we can </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">reconstruct how they filled this role. Clarence McKinnon, the minister of
 Westminster Church when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">it was located on Notre Dame and Hargrave, recalled:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:2472.19px;">“Large after meetings were held on Sunday night. The social side of life was
 vigorously organized. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Newcomers were met and welcomed. Picnics, socials followed each other in quick
 succession. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Interchurch debates enlivened the winter months, and athletic sports in the
 summer. In my first year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">a gentleman, a French Canadian, stopped me on the street to tell me how, when he
 and his wife were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">lonely on their first arrival in the city, they had strayed into Westminster
 Church on a Sunday evening </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">and how grateful they were for the happy human fellowship they found there.
 (From Winnipeg’s </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">Women became famous for hosting ‘tea-meetings’ or ‘soirees.’ Ads were often placed in the local </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">newspaper, inviting the general public to join church members for good
 conversation and various </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">programmes comprised of readings and music by the choir. Everyone was invited to
 indulge in a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">great variety of homemade delicacies — all for a nominal fee which went back to the Church coffers</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">Reverend Christie, wrote of his first winter at the church in 1909 — “it was the hey day of immigration </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">in Winnipeg. Sometimes rooming houses were not too attractive. To linger on the
 streets on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">severe winter evenings was to invite frozen ears. If the church was a mecca for
 the faithful it was also </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">a welcome refuge for the careless. Indeed on Sunday evenings the entire width of
 Hargrave Street </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">was black with the stream of people, padding almost noiselessly over the snow,
 making their way to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Knox or Central or First Baptist or Westminster. Groups could be seen, scurrying
 from one side to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">other to these over crowded sanctuaries.” (From </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">Women have always played an integral role in the life of the church. From as
 early as the nineteenth </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">century, women worked as teachers, missionaries, and nurses, providing care in
 communities. As </span>
