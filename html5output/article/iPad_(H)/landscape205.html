        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">In a sense we were not fully prepared for the traumatic change at Westminster.
 Before we left </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Lakeview we had canvassed the possibility of having a seniors’ club, but there were so few members </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">over sixty-five or seventy that such a club was considered neither necessary nor
 viable. In contrast, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">one of the most active groups at Westminster was the “Sunshine Club,” sixty or seventy-five seniors </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">who met every Friday afternoon, played cards, put on their own programs, and
 danced to the music </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">of their own orchestra. Their Christmas turkey dinner and June picnic swelled
 their numbers to over </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">one hundred.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Doris Marshall was the staff person in charge of senior programming, and later
 (because she was a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">trained deaconess) added Christian education to her busy portfolio and gave
 excellent service to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Westminster. By December, Mack MacIver, just retired from the air force
 chaplaincy with the rank of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">wing commander, joined our staff on a three-quarter time basis. A most affable
 Cape Bretoner, Mack </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">was with us for five happy years. Following a very lengthy and debilitating
 illness with multiple </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">sclerosis, his wife, Charlotte, died. Mack remarried, and he and Myrtle remain
 two of our very good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Winnipeg friends.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">We had a succession of staff members. When Mack retired, Jack Mathieson, who had
 served in North </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Honan, China, was with us for three years. When Doris Marshall moved to Toronto
 to be near her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">family and to do senior adult programming for the United Church, Susan Cawley
 became our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">deaconess. She was a recent graduate from Covenant College and was with us for
 two years. Susan </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">married Harold Atwell from Trinidad, and when he finished his studies at the
 University of Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">they moved to Trinidad. Glenys Hughes, also from Covenant College, succeeded
 Susan, and less than </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">two years later married Rev. Harry Oussoren and moved back to Toronto. Barbara
 Bryant also came to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">us when she completed her two-year course at Covenant College, but stayed for
 only one year. Upon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">leaving Westminster, Barbara attended Seneca       College in Toronto and graduated in early </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">childhood education. She married a minister and they serve jointly on a pastoral
 charge in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">Saskatchewan.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">When Barbara was leaving, and Jack Mathieson retired, the board decided we
 should move into a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">new staffing arrangement and they called a relatively young ordained minister,
 Cecil Tiller. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">seemed anxious to move west from Saint John, New Brunswick, and to undertake a
 role similar to </span>
