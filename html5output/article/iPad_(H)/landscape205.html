 only the interest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">was to be used, and, even then, only for special expenses. In our years, most of
 the very fine stained-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">glass windows were cleaned and re-leaded using interest from the Foundation
 Fund. By the time of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1019.89px;">my retirement in 1979, the foundation stood at well over $100,000. The 1991 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1370.66px;">Annual Report shows $300,000. Capital grants have been given to put a new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1721.42px;">roof on the church and to renew the heating system. I understand that interest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2072.19px;">from the fund is being used to underwrite some of the expenses of the 1992 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2422.95px;">centennial year observances. Perhaps our airfare to the centennial is being paid
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2773.72px;">from the interest on the fund which I so strongly urged the board to establish!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3324.48px;">I should mention, too, establishing the chapel. In both Edmonton and Regina, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3675.25px;">there was a separate chapel, so useful when you have a large sanctuary. Many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4026.01px;">smaller wedding and funeral services were conducted in the chapel. But there </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4376.77px;">simply didn’t seem to be any suitable location for such a facility at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Westminster, unless we used either the church parlour, always called the Ladies
 Parlour, or the so-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">called primary room which was a multi-purpose room used for Sunday school, the
 library, counting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">offering on Sunday, quilting every Thursday, and for various committee meetings.
 After some tactful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">discussion with the UCW, it was planned to use the parlour. We would have chairs
 instead of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">permanent pews. There would be a drape (on a track) behind the communion table
 and lectern and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">organ that could be pulled around to the front of the chancel area to make the
 chapel a meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">room, and all would be well. A young architect with a good sense of what we
 desired did our design </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">work. Sufficient families gave memorial contributions to cover the $18,000 cost;
 and Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">now has a most attractive chapel which seats sixty or seventy people. By
 interesting coincidence, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">first of many funerals I conducted in the chapel was that young architect’s aunt (one of the Riddell </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8235.19px;">family). The second funeral was for the mother of Ted Millman, chairman of the
 chapel building </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8585.95px;">committee. There have been many weddings, including Doug and Jane’s on August 25, 1972. We have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8936.72px;">had Sunday school teachers’ communion services. Many groups use it for at least the devotional part </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9287.48px;">of their meeting. And on only one occasion that I know of did we pull the
 reredos drape to turn the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9638.25px;">chapel into an ordinary meeting room!</span>
