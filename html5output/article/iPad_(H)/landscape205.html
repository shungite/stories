        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">really preferred preaching to CE work, and accepted a call to St. Andrew’s Church in Regina after two </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">years at Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">At this point, we changed direction quite considerably in our staffing, and
 decided to hire three staff </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">people working one-third time each. Joan McConnell, who had been a teacher
 before she and Barry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">had four children, was our Sunday school superintendent, and she became our
 director of Christian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">education. Audrey McLennan, who, before she and Norm had their three boys, had
 been a program </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">director at the YWCA, was anxious to get back into part-time work and was happy
 to work one-third </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">time as outreach coordinator. Rev. Bill Conly, just retired after serving all
 his forty years in Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">became our one-third-time retired visiting assistant. The four of us formed a
 very happy working </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">relationship, each with her or his special responsibilities. Bill Conly’s wife, Irene, was one of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Westminster Riddell family, so for them it was like coming home. Bill was with
 us until my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">retirement in 1979. Joan McConnell went with Barry to Britain for a year’s sabbatical in 1978, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">Elaine Hickerson, wife of Rev. Bill Hickerson, secretary of Manitoba conference,
 came as her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">replacement. Audrey McLennan also left in 1978 to work full- time at her home
 church, Fort Garry, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">and Orma Backhouse replaced her. Partly as a footnote, and as a point of
 interest, Joan McConnell is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">now personnel secretary of Manitoba conference. Audrey McLennan later became
 president of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Manitoba conference, and now chairs the department at head office that produces </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:11387.30px;top:5779.83px;">Spirit Connection</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:13542.27px;top:5779.83px;"> on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">Vision TV.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">The music department saw fewer changes than any other part of the staff. Herb
 Sadler was organist </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">and choir director from 1919–1953. Glen Harrison then assumed the position of choir director—and is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">still there! Barry Anderson was organist for several years, and was succeeded in
 1967 by Don </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">Menzies, who is also still in that position. With a fine, four-manual Casavant
 organ, and excellent </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">organists and choir directors, Westminster has had superlative music throughout
 its long history. In </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">our years, Glen Harrison directed many special choir recitals, and on numerous
 occasions had a half </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">dozen Winnipeg Symphony players for orchestral accompaniment. Don Menzies, as
 well as guest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">organists, have played (and broadcast) many recitals. I have heard both Marcel
 Dupré and E. Power </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">Biggs in recital on that outstanding instrument.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">Writing this much about staff, I’ll also add a word here about our custodians. When we were first at </span>
