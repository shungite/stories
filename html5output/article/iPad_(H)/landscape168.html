        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">In 1978, the United Church’s new Division of Mission in Canada (DMC) initiated a study into the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">UCWs across Canada who were struggling with the structure set in 1962 and with
 other issues. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">study recommended that it would be beneficial for Conference presidents to meet
 regularly to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">discuss issues, concerns, and projects. The gathering was to be called a
 consultation, with no </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">administrative or decision-making authority but Conference presidents continued
 to meet for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">years. In 2000, at the General Council meeting, a resolution was passed stating
 that “all women’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">groups within the Pastoral Charge or congregation are free to determine their
 size, structure, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">manner of leadership.” At the 2003 General Council meeting, The Women’s Ministries Network was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">proposed and adopted. It would encompass the UCW, the only structured group, and
 all other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">women’s groups within the United Church. In 2003, the name National Consultation of
 United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">Church Women was changed to National United Church Women (NUCW).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">What we see today is women continuing to be strong contributors to the work of
 Westminster, but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">now, not so much as a separate entity, but full partners, on the board, on
 committees, as staff, as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">volunteers and as ministers. I found a write up done by Lorna Harvey on Yvonne
 Whitehead, done in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">1984 that describes one woman’s role in the change. Yvonne transferred from Knox to Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">in 1955. She joined Unit 13 and the J.S. Bonnell Mission. She was the last
 president of UCW before </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Westminster Church went to the General Board format. Prior to the end of her
 term she was on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">committee which drew up the guide lines for the General Board. As chair of the
 Membership and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">Visiting Committee she reorganized the district visiting with the help of Gordon
 Pattison. She was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">Secretary of the Pastoral Relations Committee and a team Captain for the
 Stewardship Campaign. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Marilyn Huband who was a leader, both in the Church and in the wider community,
 and was a friend </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">to many of us here today. She brought energy, joy and insight to the needs of
 Westminster. No new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">visitor to the Church went un noticed by Marilyn — she made a point of welcoming all. And Marilyn </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">started the Mother’s Morning Off, here at the Church to provide space and time for women from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">area to come together while their children were attended. She knew it was very
 important to involve </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">young women in the affairs of the Church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">Another memory that Georgine Kerr sent me is of her mother Marguerite (Bonnie)
 Kerr who joined </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">Westminster in 1936. She attended Sunday school and CGIT. During the war years,
 she was a CGIT </span>
