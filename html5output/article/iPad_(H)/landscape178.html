        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">time went on, fundraising and social function organizing were also added to the
 women’s roles.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">When the United Church officially formed in 1925, the Ladies Aid (LA) (later the
 Woman’s Association </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">(WA) and the Women’s Missionary Society (WMS) were doing work at home and abroad by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Presbyterian and Methodist women. The WA focused on supporting the local church
 and community, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">while the WMS was more involved with education and world mission. In this period
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">continued its work with missions at home and abroad. The Westminster Ladies Aid
 Society, for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">example, financed a hospital in Eriksdale, which opened in May 1926. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Annual Reports show the important task of home visits and visits to hospitals
 done by the women </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">during those early years of Westminster Church as well as financial support.
 From the 1923 Annual </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Report: “The Church greatly appreciated the offer of the Ladies Society to aid us with
 our finances by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">giving to us the interest on Bonds they hold together with an additional 10% of
 all the monies </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">collected by them during the year. When in November Westminster Church asked for
 a special </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">collection for its budget, our Society relinquished its claim on the offering of
 the Ladies Society and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">presented it, together with an added donation from our own funds, to the special
 collection of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">church.” There were 1172 visits made to patients in hospitals. And the total givings
 amounted to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">$1,673.21. In 1925, at the time of Union, it is noted about one quarter of the
 missionary work of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">United Church was supported by the women of the Women’s Missionary Society</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">The records show that in 1928, the Women’s Auxiliary of Westminster had a membership of 78, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">contributed $1,800 to the work of The Women’s Missionary Society. There were 32 in the Mission </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Band that year, that contributed $200.00. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">I wanted to share this motto of the Women’s Missionary Society from those early years: “The World </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">for Christ Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.
 Whatsoever He saith </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">unto you, do it.” It was the ‘Do It’ that spoke to me, and continues to speak to Westminster women.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">I’d like to share with you a bit about what the work of the Women’s Auxiliary supported. This is from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">a 1928 report by a Dr. Caroline Macdonald, who did “Prison Work” — these early women who did </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">home missions were called deaconesses, the early beginnings of the diaconal
 ministry we have today. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">Dr. Macdonald states: “Statistics may be very uninteresting, but can sometimes be very instructive. </span>
