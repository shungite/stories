        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">The committee is on hold at the present time due to the financial and
 ministerial circumstances of </span>

 on Refugee </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:-56.00px;top:2321.42px;">—with our thanks to Phyllis Reader who provided this text.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:2862.44px;">Westminster Young Men’s Club</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3462.03px;">Some things are hard to pin down. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4012.80px;">For example: when did the Young Men's Club get started?</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4563.56px;">We have a report from 1912 (E.B Dearmond, President and T.S. Hamilton,
 Secretary) which suggests </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4914.33px;">that the Young Men’s Club had been in existence for some time — “A number of new members have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5265.09px;">been added, and the old ones knit more closely together …”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5815.86px;">That year they had a Valentine Social. They had a debate with St. Andrew’s Church Club-topic: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:6166.62px;">“Should Canada own and operate a navy?” Dr. Wilson of Augustine Church gave a lecture on Egypt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:6517.39px;">“with lime-light views.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7068.15px;">The Club also erected a memorial window, dedicated on June, 1912 to W.J.
 Stafford. We still enjoy that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7418.92px;">beautiful window, located in the Narthex (entrance vestibule) of the Church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7969.68px;">The picture depicts the story of David’s escape from the King who regarded him as competitor. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8320.45px;">King’s son, Jonathon (with the bow and arrow) was a very close friend of David and
 betrayed his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8671.21px;">father to help his friend. The love these two young men had for each other is
 recounted in the First </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9021.98px;">book of Samuel, Chapter 20.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9572.74px;">The Young Men’s Club held an annual picnic on July first in conjunction with the Young Ladies
 Club. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9923.50px;">The Men's prowess in sports is reported in an article on sports in this eBook.</span>
