        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">We began the discussion and study of a possible new structure of congregational
 government at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">beginning of 1969, and the final report was presented to the congregational
 meeting in January 1970. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">It was approved. The General Board (as we decided to call it) would be made up
 of nine committees, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">with four persons on each committee—worship, education, finance, property, communications, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">membership and visiting, fellowship, outreach, and nominations. There would also
 be a chairperson, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">vice chair, secretary, and treasurer, with the staff as ex officio members. Each
 board member would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">serve a four-year term, and the chair would change every second year. Each of
 the nine committees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">could add to their numbers for their own committee tasks, but all major
 decisions would be brought </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">to the monthly meeting of the General Board for final approval. This obviously
 is a very brief </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">description of a very major change in congregational government. (The text of
 the constitution is in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">my Westminster file.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">I have included this summary of our church board restructuring because it
 changed in a major way </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">the focus of my work at Westminster. It gave a whole new direction to the life
 and work of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">congregation. I was really impressed with the way in which a structure, or
 system of government, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">can change the life of a church. For many years, the congregation seemed to be
 pulled in three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">directions by the Session, by the UCW, and by the Stewards. Now, there was only
 one board. There </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">were no financial secrets tucked away in the Stewards’ safekeeping. There was no Session, so any </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">members of the congregation could be, and were, asked to serve the elements on
 Communion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">Sunday. The UCW had no secret agenda, because there was no UCW! The units were
 still meeting, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">but they came under the fellowship committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">the visitation was arranged by the membership and visiting committee. And, best
 of all, we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">finding new people every year to become board members, and all the board members
 were aware of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">all the work in the church. In short, we became a much more open society. And
 with this new breath </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8235.19px;">of fresh air blowing in the church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief
 reason, I think, why I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8585.95px;">found it easy to continue on at Westminster for a few more years, and eventually
 till retirement when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8936.72px;">I reached age sixty-five in 1979.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">There were changes in our household, too. Doug, who had enrolled in Grade 9 at
 River Heights Junior </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">High when we came to Winnipeg in 1963, went on to Kelvin High and then to do his
 BA at the </span>
