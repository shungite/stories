        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">church. The mortgage is just about paid off at this point (1992), and from now
 on, the conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">rental will become church income for Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Second, about 1965 I suggested that we should set up a foundation fund for the
 church. There were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">always people asking if there was some particular need toward which a memorial
 contribution could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">be made. Also, there were three or four small trust funds (not more than a total
 of $10,000–$15,000) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">and they were carried along year after year, reported at the annual meeting, but
 never used. No one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">quite knew what to do with them. It was my feeling that if there were a
 Foundation Fund properly set </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">up and publicized, there would be contributions made to it. Perhaps some people
 might put it into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">their wills. I knew that other churches had such a fund, including Knox in
 Winnipeg which had the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Duval Foundation, named for its first minister.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">After much discussion, the idea got off the ground. A constitution was drawn up.
 It went through the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">proper channels in the provincial government so that it was legally chartered.
 Within a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">years, two or three $10,000–$15,000 bequests were given. When the manse was sold (for a mere </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">$38,000 in those years), that money was put in. Except in unusual circumstances,
 only the interest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">was to be used, and, even then, only for special expenses. In our years, most of
 the very fine stained-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">glass windows were cleaned and re-leaded using interest from the Foundation
 Fund. By the time of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">my retirement in 1979, the foundation stood at well over $100,000. The 1991
 Annual Report shows </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">$300,000. Capital grants have been given to put a new roof on the church and to
 renew the heating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">system. I understand that interest from the fund is being used to underwrite
 some of the expenses of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">the 1992 centennial year observances. Perhaps our airfare to the centennial is
 being paid from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">interest on the fund which I so strongly urged the board to establish!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">I should mention, too, establishing the chapel. In both Edmonton and Regina,
 there was a separate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">chapel, so useful when you have a large sanctuary. Many smaller wedding and
 funeral services were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">conducted in the chapel. But there simply didn’t seem to be any suitable location for such a facility at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">Westminster, unless we used either the church parlour, always called the Ladies
 Parlour, or the so-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">called primary room which was a multi-purpose room used for Sunday school, the
 library, counting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">offering on Sunday, quilting every Thursday, and for various committee meetings.
 After some tactful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">discussion with the UCW, it was planned to use the parlour. We would have chairs
 instead of </span>
