        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">Apparently, someone from Britain was visiting Westminster that day and showed
 PUNCH the </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3612.80px;">The Westminster Children's Care Centre was established in 1965 in answer to a
 real and urgent need </span>

 Sisler  the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4314.33px;">agency was chartered under the Manitoba Companies Act as an independent,  non-profit, non-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4665.09px;">sectarian, organization existing primarily to conduct a day-care program for the
 children of working </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5015.86px;">mothers.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5566.62px;">A Committee was formed with Mr. Justice James (Jimmy) Wilson as the Chair, of
 the committee. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5917.39px;">Officers were: Bob Peeler, Vice chair (later-Chair); Tom Smith, Treasurer; Trudy
 Perkins, Director; and </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7169.68px;">Originally the Centre was open to children (Grades 1 to 6) of single moms.
 Practically, it was open to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7520.45px;">the children of single parents, mothers or fathers of children at Mulvey School.
 It was open during </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7871.21px;">the "school year", but not on holidays (Christmas, Easter and the Summer.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8421.98px;">Then, under the Day Care Act , 1986 , it was operated with a Board of Directors,
 a formal budget a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8772.74px;">Director and Staff under a set of rules and regulations.  Church people were still involved both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9123.50px;">creating lunches and snacks, and with volunteers meeting the kids from school to
 lunch at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9474.27px;">church and back again and again at close of school day. Volunteers also sat with
