        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">in the community served by Westminster Church.Under the leadership of Dr. George
 Sisler  the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">agency was chartered under the Manitoba Companies Act as an independent,  non-profit, non-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">sectarian, organization existing primarily to conduct a day-care program for the
 children of working </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">mothers.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">A Committee was formed with Mr. Justice James (Jimmy) Wilson as the Chair, of
 the committee. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Officers were: Bob Peeler, Vice chair (later-Chair); Tom Smith, Treasurer; Trudy
 Perkins, Director; and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Lorraine Perkins, Assistant Director. Other members of the Committee (as of
 1973): M. Leithead, M. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Armstrong, C. Lamont, R. Friesen, M. Brown, H. Badger, I. Lees and Dr. Murray
 Campbell.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Originally the Centre was open to children (Grades 1 to 6) of single moms.
 Practically, it was open to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">the children of single parents, mothers or fathers of children at Mulvey School.
 It was open during </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">the "school year", but not on holidays (Christmas, Easter and the Summer.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">Then, under the Day Care Act , 1986 , it was operated with a Board of Directors,
 a formal budget a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Director and Staff under a set of rules and regulations.  Church people were still involved both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">creating lunches and snacks, and with volunteers meeting the kids from school to
 lunch at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">church and back again and again at close of school day. Volunteers also sat with
 them and chatted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">during lunch hours. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">In 1995 it was incorporated as a Government agency. The Centre can handle 50
 children. Twelve </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">spaces are reserved for children ages 4 and 5. They come to the Centre before
 school (nursery and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Kindergarten)  in the morning, have breakfast and are then taken to school by staff. They are
 then </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">picked up by stafff at 11:30, returned to the Centre and given lunch. They then
 stay at the Centre till </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">they are picked up by their parents after work.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">There are 38 spaces for children ages 6 to 12. They have the same regimen
 morning and noon but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">return to school for the afternoon. Then they are picked up at the end of school
 day and returned to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">the Centre where they are picked up by their parents.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">As a government agency  the Centre now operates full time (during school holidays and summer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">vacation). According to staff the numbers of children attending varies during
 these "holiday" times </span>
