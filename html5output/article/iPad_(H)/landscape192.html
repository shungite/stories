        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">It has been my privilege to represent Westminster at Presbytery, Manitoba
 Conference, The World </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Congress of Sunday School  Workers held in Toronto (where we had a delegation of seven), at A.O.T.S. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">conventions in Vancouver, Banff, Kingston and Halifax which we also enjoyed, and
 we have had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">busy, happy time.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">We have benefitted greatly in having the opportunity of association with the
 fine people of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Westminster, and we have been proud of our church wherever visits were made.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">Looking backward the outstanding things in all the years have been the
 association with  the Boys’ </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Department for many years, and later the 15 years editing the Westminster
 Newsletter.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3373.72px;">This church is ALIVE! Attend as an observer at one of the 44 member Board
 meetings gathered </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">around a square and where the chairmen have done lots of homework in preparing
 their arguments  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">and briefs. This is not a ‘Yes Men’ organization. Matters of Westminster are thoroughly discussed and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">agreed upon.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">I welcomed the opportunity of the Newsletter Editor to write down a few thoughts
 of the past years. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">All these years have been a family team effort. My wife and I still enjoy our
 membership and are </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">happy to realize that our daughter, Marilyn, has taken up the reins.”</span>

        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:8022.38px;">Reverend Reid Vipond</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:8621.98px;">When our eighth minister, Reid Vipond, wrote his memoirs in 1992, chapter 15 was
 entitled Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:8972.74px;">Revisited (1963-1979). In this section of his book he gave us an incredibly
 detailed look at what and where </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:9323.50px;">we were as a congregation for those 16 years. For a man of 80 years of age his
 memory for detail was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:9674.27px;">amazing. We present the whole chapter here (7800 words!) with pleasure  and we thank </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:10025.04px;">Reid’s daughter, Mary, for sharing it with us.</span>
