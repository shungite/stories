        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">It was 1885. The growth of Winnipeg’s population and commercial sector was accelerating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">at an incredible pace, which it would maintain for the next several decades. An
 industrial force </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">was transforming this small, frozen, and isolated town of 2000 people — made up primarily of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Aboriginals, Métis, Scot, English and French, and latched to a Hudson’s Bay Company fur trading </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">post called Fort Garry — into a bustling hub, a ‘Gateway To The West.’ That force was, of course, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">the railway — more specifically the transcontinental railway, whose “last spike” was driven </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">into the ground that same year. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Such changes were greeted by Winnipeg’s diverse population with excitement and anger, malaise </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">and optimism; the rapid modernization of this prairie town would have its
 winners and losers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">divided along the predictable fault lines of race and class. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">First, there was the laying of thousands of miles of tracks over land that had
 from the beginning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">of time been open and seemingly boundless — the home of Blackfoot, Cree, Ojibwa, and other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">First Nations, along with their Métis cousins. Surveyors parceled the natives’ land into plots </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">for homesteading; land that nourished the natives’ spiritual beliefs and supported their livelihood. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">They had tried to negotiate with the white man’s government located far to the East — and were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">pointedly ignored. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">Then came the steam-belching locomotives that pulled strings of carriages
 holding thousands </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">of people who would also come to depend for their lives on the land. Their main
 wish was to work, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">farm, raise crops and families. Some were from Upper Canada — Ontario — but many more, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">thousands even, were streaming in from across at the Atlantic. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">They, too, had lost their land, many driven from homes they had know for
 generations due </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">to religious persecution, famine, and unendurable poverty. But what did they
 know or care about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">the people they were displacing, and the devastating effects this displacement
 would have on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">the natives’ traditional economies and culture? How much did the average new settler know </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">of the treaties, and their unfulfilled promises to provide the Aboriginals with
 the tools — fertile </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">land, farm animals, and equipment — to transition to an agricultural way of life, and would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">it have troubled their conscience? To the extent that such would ever trouble
