        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">Shortly after we arrived in 1963, there were discussions about some kind of
 church-sponsored child </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">care on a permanent basis. As early as 1948 or 1949, there had been a weekday
 play school that our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">two-year-old Francie (as the minister’s child) was allowed to attend, though the lower age limit was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">three. But, by 1965, with the active assistance of Mrs. Gretta Brown (daughter
 of the late Charles W. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Gordon—“Ralph Connor”), we looked at the possibility of a lunch and after- school program for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">kindergarten to Grade 3 boys and girls of nearby Mulvey School who were children
 of sole-support </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">working mothers. After a year of planning, getting the program officially
 recognized by the provincial </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">government, and with funding in place by the church, the government and the
 mothers, the project </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">began. Major funding was eventually picked up by the government, with the church
 supplying all the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">facilities and the volunteers. We began with one staff person and twenty-five or
 so children. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">program has grown, and for many years has had two workers and forty to fifty
 children. A large </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">group of volunteers assist at meal time. All equipment has been upgraded to
 fulfill the Board of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Health requirements. Members of the congregation carry most of the
 responsibility for the work of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">the child care board. It is such a well-established program that one couldn’t imagine Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">without it.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">The church sanctuary, halls, and meeting rooms are used by many groups in the
 city. The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">Chamber Orchestra has its four or five concerts each year in the sanctuary, and
 the orchestra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">members use most of the facilities for rehearsing. At times, it was somewhat a
 nuisance, but this was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">offset for me by the personal joy to give over my vestry to many guest artists.
 I remember best of all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Liona Boyd, Ivan Moravec, Elmer Iseler, and the Canadian Brass.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">Several high schools still have their June graduations in the sanctuary. Mrs.
 Litz’s Mennonite </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">Children’s Choir made several of their records in our church. The Winnipeg Ladies Choir,
 mainly a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">Mennonite choir, also used the sanctuary. The acoustics are excellent, and even
 more important, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">welcome mat was always out.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">Many other community groups use the excellent facilities at Westminster. At
 election time, we had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">all-candidates’ meetings. Several organizations, such as the Peace Action Committee, use space
