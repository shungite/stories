        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">from Winnipeg, a graduate of U of T in early childhood education and from the
 Toronto Royal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Conservatory as a clarinetist and now has a large clarinet class. They, too, are
 proud parents—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Nicholas, May 24, 1979, and Samuel, October 18, 1983.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Rob finished Grade 12 at Kelvin in Winnipeg in 1971 and enrolled at U of T in
 political science. His </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">summer employment was in Winnipeg in government-sponsored educational projects.
 After </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">graduation in 1975, he spent a year in Geneva at the Graduate Institute of
 International Affairs, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">returned to Toronto to do an MA, then to Harvard to study government. He joined
 the U of T political </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">science department in 1981 and completed his PhD about two years later. He met
 Gina Feldberg at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Harvard, and they were married on June 26, 1983 at Harvard Chapel. Gina has
 since completed her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">PhD in the history of medicine, and is on staff at York University in Toronto.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">I had the joy of performing all four weddings—in London, Winnipeg, Montreal, and Boston. Why not? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Someone asked Doug who was going to conduct his wedding. “My dad, of course. When you’ve got a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">minister in the family, why pay five bucks to bring someone else in?” Indeed so!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">In the spring of 1978, I told the board at Westminster that I would be retiring
 in June 1979. After the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">summer, a pastoral relations committee was formed, but didn’t become very active until early 1979. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">They moved through the usual stages of meetings with presbytery representatives,
 setting out goals, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">looking at new directions. I was aware (as usually happens) of some of their
 plans, but kept out of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">way as much as possible. However, by the end of May 1979, they had made their
 choice—Rev. Bob </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Thompson, associate with Bob Shanks at St. Andrew’s-Wesley in Vancouver.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">We had the usual happy retirement parties. At Manitoba conference, at the end of
 May, I received my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">pen-and-pencil set. (Some three years before, about three dozen sets had been
 purchased from a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">jewellery store that was going out of business; “It will save the conference committee the trouble of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">looking for retiree gifts each year,” Fred Douglas remarked.) There was a staff party for both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">Conlys and us at Orma Backhouse’s cottage at Victoria Beach, and several other groups had parties, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">too. The big event, however, was the salad supper at the church, serving six to
 seven hundred people. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">Following the meal, a program was held in the church, with presentations of
 roses to Dorothy; for me, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">a Sunday school picture book done by all the Sunday school kids; a Yashica
 camera from the board; a </span>
