        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">were no financial secrets tucked away in the Stewards’ safekeeping. There was no Session, so any </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">members of the congregation could be, and were, asked to serve the elements on
 Communion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Sunday. The UCW had no secret agenda, because there was no UCW! The units were
 still meeting, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">but they came under the fellowship committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">the visitation was arranged by the membership and visiting committee. And, best
 of all, we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">finding new people every year to become board members, and all the board members
 were aware of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">all the work in the church. In short, we became a much more open society. And
 with this new breath </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">of fresh air blowing in the church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief
 reason, I think, why I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">found it easy to continue on at Westminster for a few more years, and eventually
 till retirement when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">I reached age sixty-five in 1979.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">There were changes in our household, too. Doug, who had enrolled in Grade 9 at
 River Heights Junior </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">High when we came to Winnipeg in 1963, went on to Kelvin High and then to do his
 BA at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">University of Winnipeg, graduating with the gold medal for highest standing in
 the general arts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">course. He had worked each summer (on the end of a hoe) at the University of
 Manitoba farm, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">had a bank account to go to York University in Toronto in the fall of 1970 to
 pursue a PhD in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">psychology. So, in our huge manse at 141 Waterloo Street (3,200 square feet of
 floor space and a 100 × </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">150 foot property), we were down to one family member at home. Rob had proceeded
 through </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">elementary, junior high, and was now (1970–1971) in his final year at Kelvin High School and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">made his decision to go east for his university work. We certainly didn’t need this huge manse. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">Dorothy was already on part-time staff at Laura Second as teacher-librarian,
 having taken the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">necessary five courses at U of M. A smaller home would suit us better. It would
 also give us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">opportunity to get some equity in a house, so that upon retirement we wouldn’t simply leave the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">keys on the kitchen counter and face the prospect of having to buy a home at
 that late stage.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">I spoke to some of the people on the board who had been around for years about
 buying our own </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">house, although I assured them that if the congregation felt strongly about
 retaining its manse we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">could no doubt accommodate ourselves to their decision. Fortunately, the church
 board was very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">happy to get out of the property business. The manse was sold. We purchased a
 very suitable three-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">bedroom bungalow at 718 Waterloo Street, and one of Rob’s last jobs at home before going to U of T </span>
