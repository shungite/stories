        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The next evening a group of 12 year old lads called at my room in the Y and
 invited me to come as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">their teacher. An auspicious start.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Westminster has always had grand ministers and very able associates. When pulpit
 supply was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">required, outstanding ministers or laymen fro all corners of the east preached.
 They included our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">own church missionary from China and our own Sunday School missionary from
 India.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">A large Bible was kept on the pulpit which visitors and preachers signed. Names
 such as Dr. Grenfell  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">of Labrador, Ramsey MacDonald, former Prime Minister of Britain, Rev. Professor
 Moffat (translator of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">the Bible) and many others signed. Sad to relate vandal stole that historic
 Bible and it has never been </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">recovered.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">Times and customs of dress change. On a hot Sunday in June, 1923, I was inducted
 as an elder.It was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">usual to wear a dark suit, tie, etc. and white shirt. My suited been to the
 cleaners and it reeked of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">gasoline. The new elder next to me kept sniffing during the ceremony. I was warm
 enough on that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">hot Sunday, but became more uncomfortable when the minister announced the title
 of his sermon; </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">he kept repeating it and seemed to look my way each time. The title of the
 sermon was ‘Christian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">Fragrance.’</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">One event each year was the congregational picnic at the parks. One year we
 hired a C.N.R. four or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">five coach train, sold tickets all over Winnipeg and spent the Saturday
 afternoon at Victoria Beach. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">They gave me $200.00 to buy prizes and we spent it all. When the races started
 every person or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">stranger at Victoria Beach turned up to get in on the races and the grand prize
 list. Senator John T. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">Haig acted as our policeman and saw to it that no-one took part unless they were
 connected with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">In the early twenties many of the large homes in the vicinity of Westminster
 were occupied by our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">members and their large families. The result was our Sunday School had a large
 attendance and at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">one time we had the largest Sunday School enrolment of any Presbyterian Church
 in Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">We had a boys’ department of around 150 boys between 12 and 17. This Department had been well </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">organized by the late Walter MacDonald and he had a powerful executive which met
