        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">from 1969–1979, first part-time, then full-time, she was on the Laura Secord Elementary
 School staff. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">With an honours BA from Queen’s, a BEd from the University of Alberta, and the library course at U </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">of M, she well merited a special Dorothy Vipond retirement party at Laura
 Secord.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Mary had gone to Queen’s on a General Motors scholarship while we were in Regina, and her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">graduation in 1964 coincided with our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. She did
 her MA in history at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">the University of Toronto, and worked for a year and a half editing the foreign
 trade newsletter for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. But she soon recognized that she wanted an
 academic life, so </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">enrolled in a PhD program at U of T. She was a teaching assistant for a year at
 Scarborough College, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">then joined the history staff at Loyola in Montreal (later amalgamated with Sir
 George Williams to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">become Concordia University.) Completing her PhD after a couple of years
 teaching, she has </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">continued on staff there. She and Bill Butler were married on October 9, 1977,
 at their home in NDG, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">and are the proud parents of Peter, born August 25, 1978, and Catherine, born
 May 26, 1980. Bill is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">also a grad of Queen’s (1964) and has an MA from the University of Toronto (1965). He teaches </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">mathematics in a CEGEP in Montreal.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Fran went to Queen’s on a provincial scholarship the summer we moved to Winnipeg (1963). She </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">worked one summer (1964) in Winnipeg prior to our family trip overseas, and the
 other summers did </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">typing and computer work for some professors in the English department at Queen’s. She graduated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">in honours history and English in 1967, and obtained a teaching position at
 Wheable Secondary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6758.85px;">School in London. On June 29, 1968, she and Don Menard (also a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-60" style="left:8922.13px;top:6735.47px;">ʼ</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8984.43px;top:6758.85px;">67 history grad from Queen’s) were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7155.54px;">married in the chapel of First-St. Andrew’s in London. Following a year of social work in Toronto, Don </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7506.31px;">joined the Laurier Secondary staff in London. Fran was at Wheable until they
 became the proud </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7857.07px;">parents of David (August 15, 1974) and Beth (December 22, 1976.) Fran has been
 extremely active in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8207.84px;">church and community work as well as being available for substitute teaching.
 Even more important </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8558.60px;">for Dorothy and me personally, Fran keeps in close touch with our “going out” and our “coming in.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8909.37px;">She checks our house and our mail and does our banking when we are away. Without
 her assistance, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9260.13px;">we would not be able to do our worry-free travelling. Besides being head of
 history at Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9610.90px;">Secondary School now, Don is also available for chores at 406 Wortley that are
 too heavy for an </span>
