        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:2911.27px;">When our eighth minister, Reid Vipond, wrote his memoirs in 1992, chapter 15 was
 entitled Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:3262.03px;">Revisited (1963-1979). In this section of his book he gave us an incredibly
 detailed look at what and where </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:3612.80px;">we were as a congregation for those 16 years. For a man of 80 years of age his
 memory for detail was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:3963.56px;">amazing. We present the whole chapter here (7800 words!) with pleasure  and we thank </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:4314.33px;">Reid’s daughter, Mary, for sharing it with us.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4865.09px;">Reid writes:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5415.86px;">We so thoroughly enjoyed the British television version of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:8032.64px;top:5415.86px;">Brideshead Revisited</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:10627.01px;top:5415.86px;">, that I thought the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5766.62px;">heading ‘Westminster Revisited’ was at least somewhat appropriate for this chapter. We, too, found </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6117.39px;">ourselves reliving our earlier years, 1946–1949, often reminiscing with parishioners about the glory </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6468.15px;">days back in the forties when the church was packed every Sunday morning; when
 an average </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6818.92px;">Sunday evening service had an attendance of three or four hundred; when there
 were between 100 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7169.68px;">and 150 in the Apex Young People’s group; when I organized the junior youth group (mostly Grade 11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7520.45px;">and 12 young people) whose innovative programs were among the most imaginative I
 have ever seen. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7871.21px;">I’ll never forget the evening they conducted a funeral for “the church” — complete with a casket </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8221.98px;">(borrowed from Mordue’s Funeral Home). After a very impressive eulogy in which the church’s earlier </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">virtues were extolled, the casket was opened and those attending were invited to
 “please come </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">forward now to view the deceased.” How surprised we were when we looked in the silk-lined casket </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9274.27px;">to see ourselves, reflected in a mirror that had been appropriately placed at
 just the right angle in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9625.04px;">bottom of the casket!</span>
