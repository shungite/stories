        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Session, plus people who were on the finance and property committee. There was
 no Committee of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Stewards; this function was performed by the Deacon’s Court.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Somewhere in Dr. Allen Huband’s tenure (1948–1955), the decision was made to follow the United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Church Manual which called for a Session, a Committee of Stewards, and an
 Official Board. In general </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">terms, the Session has oversight over things spiritual, the Stewards over things
 temporal, and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Official Board is a combination of these two (plus presidents of all
 organizations). Also, it has the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">power to act on behalf of the congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">But there has always been a problem here. Why should we divide the spiritual and
 the temporal? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Aren’t they all of a piece, really? Why should one particular group (the Stewards) do
 all the property </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">work, and even more especially, all the financial decisions? Granted, all
 decisions are supposed to be </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">checked by the Official Board, but this is usually only rubber-stamping. Also,
 it makes difficult </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">communication within a church. Despite the Good Book to the contrary, the left
 hand should know </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">what the right is doing!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">Another problem with the board structure at Westminster (common in many
 churches) was that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">there seemed to be no terminal point for many office holders. For example, when
 we went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Westminster in 1963, the same man had been clerk of Session for a dozen years or
 more and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">same person had held the position as chairman of Stewards for ten years. Also,
 there were only three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">or four women on these boards.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">To discuss possible changes, we organized a four-hour session, which we called a
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">forum. This may have been where the idea was born, viz., to have one church
 board as the governing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">body of our congregation. Out of that idea we decided to have three groups meet—the executives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">the UCW, of Stewards, and of Session—together with staff. It is not possible to describe all that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">happened in that year of monthly meetings. But it soon became apparent how much
 overlapping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">there was: e.g., both the UCW and the stewards had finance and property
 committees; both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">Session and the UCW had a mission committee and a flower committee, to give only
 a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">examples. As well, there were times when people had to report to both Stewards
 and Session, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">maybe, as well, to the Official Board. It was a clumsy and an inefficient type
 of organization. But, in </span>
