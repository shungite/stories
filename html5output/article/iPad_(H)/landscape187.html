 tirelessly to collect and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">distribute surplus medical supplies to developing countries from Manitoba
 sources.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">And Christine McKee who Tom Carter, former Institute of Urban Studies
 (University of Winnipeg) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Director and Canada Research Chair in Urban Change &amp; Adaptation, shared his admiration for McKee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">by way of written message. “Christine understood cities and she was a strong advocate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">comprehensive planning and revitalization of the inner city. She was also a very
 strong advocate for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">the more marginalized in society. Her tireless work for better quality of life
 for those in the inner city </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">was part of her strong commitment to planning equity.” She was an impetus for the Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Housing Foundation and the work that continues today to provide adequate housing
 for families in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">the area around this church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Another to mention, was Lorraine Sweatman. She and Alan were frequent attendees
 of the Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">church Service, and Dick and I regularly shared comments with them about the
 sermon. She served </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">on many committees and was chair of the board. I found this note, actually in
 Isabel Auld’s papers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">acknowledging the work she had done organizing a fellowship and fashion, in
 1988, which generated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">almost $1,000.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Isabel Auld, is another member to highlight and acknowledge her contribution to
 the Church and to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">the community. She died in March 2016 She served as chair of the Board of
 Westminster, and was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">active on many committees and belonged to a Circle. Yet, somehow, she managed to
 have a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">active community life, enriching the life of so many in this city. Her faith led
 her to many other ways </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">of enriching our community. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">And we need to recognize the work of woman like Margaret Hodson, who has managed
 the kitchen </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">so well for Westminster in her quiet and effective manner, plus giving and
 supporting the Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">and community in many ways. And the many women who volunteer at the Bell Tower
 Community </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">Café. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">Let’s close with a round of applause for the many women who have gone before us, and
 who have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">given us inspiration, and gratitude for the many services rendered to
 Westminster Church, and to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">wider community.</span>
