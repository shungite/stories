        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">important areas of concern.We simply worked harder to keep young men involved.
 Sports, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">fellowship.More sports. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">I think of my own home (time period- 1930-1950) where mother was never apprised
 of how much </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">money my father was earning. He gave her an allowance to run the house. No
 questions asked. No </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">information shared. If she had the need to buy an article of clothing she had to
 ask father for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">money. He would decide. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">This inbred belief that a woman couldn't make the big decisions was in both our
 micro and macro </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">worlds. Then, sometime in the early 1950s someone (or someones) encouraged
 people in the United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Church to recognize this male blindness. It took 9 years (1953 -62),  “painstaking study” and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:3524.48px;">“wrestling with the problem” to turn this thinking around. it took another 8 years for Westminster to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">shuck off its Elders and Session and institute a General Board. With women.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">The most visible leader in the  move to create a General Board was Marilyn Huband. I could  suggest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">others, also, where instrumental on the process. But Marilyn became ground zero.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">In 1968 Mrs. C. R. Huband (Marilyn) was elected President of Winipeg
 Presbyterial (note the the last 4 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">letters of that word) of United Church Women,  and Mrs. Robert Jeske (Betty Jeske) was elected </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">Treasurer.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6579.83px;">NOTE: Jon please insert UCW 30 at the side of this section of text.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7130.60px;">From those positions pressure was exerted to introduce the concept of Board at
 Westminster, which </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7481.36px;">was realized in 1970 with Marilyn elected as the first Chair.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8032.13px;">A side note: In 1970 I , (R.H.),  was responsible for organizing the service of Communion  four times a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8382.89px;">year ( a task I had for ten years.). My job was to find 10 or 12 volunteers to
 be the servers each </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8733.66px;">Communion.. By tradition the servers were always men. Shortly after the new
 Board took office </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9084.42px;">Marilyn Huband phoned me:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9635.19px;">M: Roy, you are responsible for recruiting communion servers are you not?</span>
