        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The Club also erected a memorial window, dedicated on June, 1912 to W.J.
 Stafford. We still enjoy that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">beautiful window, located in the Narthex (entrance vestibule) of the Church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">The picture depicts the story of David’s escape from the King who regarded him as competitor. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">King’s son, Jonathon (with the bow and arrow) was a very close friend of David and
 betrayed his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">father to help his friend. The love these two young men had for each other is
 recounted in the First </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">book of Samuel, Chapter 20.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">The Young Men’s Club held an annual picnic on July first in conjunction with the Young Ladies
 Club. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">The Men's prowess in sports is reported in an article on sports in this eBook.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3373.72px;">So they were an active and vibrant group during the ministries of both McKinnon
 and Christie. And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">then they faded and failed. Fast forward to 1928 and the beginning of the second
 Young Men's Club. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">This was at the tail end of the Christie years with the coming of John
 Sutherland Bonnell to take </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">place in 1929.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">An article in 1937 by Club secretary, Leslie Hunt, starts with a flurry of news
 reports from September </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">1928: “Screeching from out of the Indies a tropical hurricane, like a giant sword
 unsheathed, raced </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">over Florida, cutting down everything in its path and leaving behind 1000 dead
 and 700,000 homeless </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-84.00px;top:6029.07px;">… People in Winnipeg walked the streets in fear as schools remained closed, and
 the death toll from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">dread infantile paralysis slipped past the hundred mark … From far off China, came news of a terrible </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">Moslem rebellion, with the massacres’ toll reaching 200,000 … Then Leslie gets down to work and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">switches to good news; the Club’s beginning.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">Two men in the congregation, James Crowe (see the article on our founders) and
 Stanley Jones (see </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">the article on The Actimist Club) called together 12 young men on September 25th
 and proposed the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">formation of a Young Men’s Club. Two weeks later the Club was formed with Matt Tennent as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">President. Matt was soon transferred down East and was replaced by Eddie Grant.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">Leslie goes on to recount the Club’s activities: to the little settlement of Cormorant, on the Hudson </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">Bay Railway went a bundle of Christmas cheer, gladdening the hearts of 22
 children. From the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">perspective of the 21st Century we picture a group of children spread out on the
 floor stone drunk </span>
