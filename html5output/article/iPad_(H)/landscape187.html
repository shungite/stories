        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">This family has remained in Winnipeg and became employed with all the girls
 receiving their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">education here in the city. This was a successful sponsorship.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">2) I received a letter in the church office on April 2, 2000 from an Allahyar
 Raza. I interviewed him </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">and his request from the church was to sponsor his brother, Khalil Raza who was
 a teenager trapped </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">in Moscow, Russia. He had been separated from his family during the Afghanistan
 war. Allahyar was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">prepared to support his brother financially, emotionally and culturally. He
 wanted the documentation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">done by Westminster United Church as Immigration Canada would not accept his
 application as he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">was a student at University of Winnipeg. The Outreach Committee and the Board of
 the Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">accepted this application and it went through the process with Immigration
 Canada. Due to the 9/11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">attacks in New York City in 2001 there were numerous delays. On Sept. 29th, 2003
 Khalil Raza arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">at the Winnipeg airport to the absolute joy of his brother, Allahyar. The church
 gave him $500.00 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">clothing and some miscellaneous items to get started. He quickly became employed
 and excelled in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">his new home. He is married and now lives in Vancouver, B.C. Again a very
 successful sponsorship.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">3) Eric Rivera and his wife, Indrani Ospina and 4 sons had fled Columbia, South
 America in 1997. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Their journey to Canada was filled with terror and uncertainty. They were living
 in Winnipeg. On </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">April 22, 2002 they came to Westminster United Church asking for financial help.
 Their application </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">with Immigration Canada was due to run out on June 30th, 2002 and it cost
 $1300.00 for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">application. With the support of the Outreach Committee the money was given to
 them from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">Refugee Fund. They have remained in Winnipeg and went on to be excellent
 Canadian citizens.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">The Refugee Committee was recreated again in April, 2014. Phyllis Reader was the
 chair and Val </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">McIntyre was her assistant. (Val at left)They created an application form for “family reunification” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">sponsorship with Westminster United Church. The rationale was the church would
 not be financially </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">responsible for the refugee but the requesting applicant would take full
 responsibility for their family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">member. The Betty Halstead Refugee Fund would act as a slush fund if needed. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">There were several applicants. Phyllis and Val did interviews with recorded
 notes. In all cases the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">applicants proved not to be appropriate for the mandate of the committee.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">The committee is on hold at the present time due to the financial and
 ministerial circumstances of </span>
