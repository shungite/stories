        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Many other community groups use the excellent facilities at Westminster. At
 election time, we had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">all-candidates’ meetings. Several organizations, such as the Peace Action Committee, use space
 on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">our third-floor meeting hall (called the concert hall after the stage was
 erected in the early seventies). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">For a number of years, the gym was used each Sunday afternoon for recreation and
 refreshments for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">ex-psychiatric patients, men and women, who used to be at the Selkirk Mental
 Hospital, but who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1798.91px;">were now living in the community. The program “Mothers</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-60" style="left:8007.75px;top:1775.52px;">ʼ</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8070.05px;top:1798.91px;"> Morning Off” is still going strong. And </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2195.60px;">again, the list goes on.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3297.13px;">Despite the number of pages in this account of “Westminster Revisited,” I have said nothing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3647.89px;">my involvement with the mission board. In 1965 I was asked to be the conference
 convenor of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3998.66px;">Overseas Missions Committee, which, apart from chairing conference committee
 meetings, meant a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4349.42px;">four-day meeting in Toronto each November. It also meant an involvement in the
 Prairie Conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4700.19px;">on World Mission, an ecumenical and international meeting for two days each
 spring of clergy and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5050.95px;">laity from Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Northwestern Ontario, as well as people
 from North and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5401.72px;">South Dakota and Minnesota. Both the national church boards and the cross-border
 ecumenical </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5752.48px;">programs were interesting and, I think, worthwhile.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6303.25px;">The interfaith contacts were also very valuable, especially to meet monthly or
 so with clergy, priests, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6654.01px;">and rabbis in Winnipeg, and to have occasional joint services in synagogues and
 cathedrals. Who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7004.78px;">was it once said, “I don’t like that person,” and his friend replied, “But you don’t know him.” “No,” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7355.54px;">was the response, “and that’s why I don’t like him.” When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Michael </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7706.31px;">Ramsey, was in Winnipeg in 1966, I was the United Church representative who took
 part in the huge </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8057.07px;">service of celebration (thanks to the fact that general council was being held
 at that time and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8407.84px;">president of conference was away). The service was televised nationwide on CBC,
 and as we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8758.60px;">lining up for a very formal procession, I found myself immediately ahead of the
 Knights of Columbus, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9109.37px;">with their sheathed swords. Turning to one of the K of C group, I said that if
 any of the Orange Lodge </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9460.13px;">people from Donegal were to see me on television along with the Knights of
 Columbus, they would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9810.90px;">have a fit! “Well, let’s give them something to talk about then,” he said, unsheathing his sword, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10161.66px;">putting the bare blade dangerously close to my neck!</span>
