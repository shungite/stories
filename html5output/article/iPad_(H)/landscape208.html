        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The other obstacle had been, that she had been trying to enlist Bob on this new
 adventure, but with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">no idea of where she was going or for how long she would be there, Bob was
 reluctant. He had other </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">thing he wanted to do with his retirement.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Finally, at Christmas time in 2004, Lorraine made up her mind that 2005 was
 going to be the year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">and in a matter of a week or two, through a friend of a friend, she was given
 the name of Dwight </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">DeLong, an American who has started a foundation in Romania for caring for
 orphans. She emailed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">him and asked if he had any volunteer work for a 59 year old woman who just
 wanted to cuddle </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">babies. He said come ahead, and that she did. Another woman from the church
 asked if she could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">join the expedition, and plans moved so quickly for the two of them, that
 Lorraine’s passport arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:3324.48px;">on a Friday, just in time for her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:3675.25px;">Monday departure. She flew from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:4026.01px;">Kelowna to Vancouver to Frankfurt to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:4376.77px;">Budapest in Hungary, where she was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:4727.54px;">picked up by a van, and driven just </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:5078.30px;">three hours, over the Romanian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:5429.07px;">border to Oradea. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:5979.83px;">When Lorraine and Betty arrived in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:6330.60px;">Oradea, they discovered that, in fact, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:6681.36px;">caring for babies under 2 years of age, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:7032.13px;">was a new undertaking for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:7382.89px;">Foundation, and much of the two </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:7733.66px;">months they were there, was spent </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8703.22px;top:8084.42px;">orienting the Romanian workers to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">this new undertaking. They worked on a floor of the children’s hospital in Oradea which housed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">babies up to the age of two years. The great majority of these babies had been
 born to Roma (gypsy) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">parents. The Roma custom is for the women to marry very young, and so they have
 large families, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">born into extreme poverty. The work of the foundation was to help the babies
 develop socially and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">physically so that they were healthy in more than a medical sense, as they moved
 back home, or into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10189.01px;">foster homes, and they had some degree of success. </span>
