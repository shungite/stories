        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Westminster Church went to the General Board format. Prior to the end of her
 term she was on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">committee which drew up the guide lines for the General Board. As chair of the
 Membership and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">Visiting Committee she reorganized the district visiting with the help of Gordon
 Pattison. She was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Secretary of the Pastoral Relations Committee and a team Captain for the
 Stewardship Campaign. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Marilyn Huband who was a leader, both in the Church and in the wider community,
 and was a friend </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">to many of us here today. She brought energy, joy and insight to the needs of
 Westminster. No new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">visitor to the Church went un noticed by Marilyn — she made a point of welcoming all. And Marilyn </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">started the Mother’s Morning Off, here at the Church to provide space and time for women from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">area to come together while their children were attended. She knew it was very
 important to involve </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">young women in the affairs of the Church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Another memory that Georgine Kerr sent me is of her mother Marguerite (Bonnie)
 Kerr who joined </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Westminster in 1936. She attended Sunday school and CGIT. During the war years,
 she was a CGIT </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">leader. She and Murray were active in the 50/50 Club. For many years she was a
 leader of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">afternoon church circle. She was involved in the big Westminster church teas,
 held the first </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Wednesday of May, contributing baking. Onnumber of these, she was the convener
 for the tea. She </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">was the chair of the Fellowship committee for many years. People described
 Bonnie as considerate, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">elegant, caring and friendly – and as Georgine says, Westminster was part of her life. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">There are many in our recent history that have been in the forefront of
 leadership in Westminster — </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">we continue to remember Betty Halstead and her support of Refugees. There is
 record by a refugee of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Betty’s work — “Betty Halstead was in the heart of our efforts. Hers were the most difficult
 tasks, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">she did them with great joy and enthusiasm. Betty was a true leader, with always
 positive approach, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">giving encouragement when needed, taking initiative when needed, breaking
 through cultural </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">differences when needed.” There is also a choral scholarship in Betty’s name here at Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">And the work of Phyllis Reader and International Hope. Phyllis has worked
 tirelessly to collect and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">distribute surplus medical supplies to developing countries from Manitoba
 sources.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">And Christine McKee who Tom Carter, former Institute of Urban Studies
 (University of Winnipeg) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">Director and Canada Research Chair in Urban Change &amp; Adaptation, shared his admiration for McKee </span>
