        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">newspaper, inviting the general public to join church members for good
 conversation and various </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">programmes comprised of readings and music by the choir. Everyone was invited to
 indulge in a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">great variety of homemade delicacies — all for a nominal fee which went back to the Church coffers</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Reverend Christie, wrote of his first winter at the church in 1909 — “it was the hey day of immigration </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">in Winnipeg. Sometimes rooming houses were not too attractive. To linger on the
 streets on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">severe winter evenings was to invite frozen ears. If the church was a mecca for
 the faithful it was also </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">a welcome refuge for the careless. Indeed on Sunday evenings the entire width of
 Hargrave Street </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">was black with the stream of people, padding almost noiselessly over the snow,
 making their way to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Knox or Central or First Baptist or Westminster. Groups could be seen, scurrying
 from one side to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">other to these over crowded sanctuaries.” (From </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Women have always played an integral role in the life of the church. From as
 early as the nineteenth </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">century, women worked as teachers, missionaries, and nurses, providing care in
 communities. As </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">time went on, fundraising and social function organizing were also added to the
 women’s roles.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">When the United Church officially formed in 1925, the Ladies Aid (LA) (later the
 Woman’s Association </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">(WA) and the Women’s Missionary Society (WMS) were doing work at home and abroad by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">Presbyterian and Methodist women. The WA focused on supporting the local church
 and community, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">while the WMS was more involved with education and world mission. In this period
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">continued its work with missions at home and abroad. The Westminster Ladies Aid
 Society, for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">example, financed a hospital in Eriksdale, which opened in May 1926. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">Annual Reports show the important task of home visits and visits to hospitals
 done by the women </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">during those early years of Westminster Church as well as financial support.
 From the 1923 Annual </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">Report: “The Church greatly appreciated the offer of the Ladies Society to aid us with
 our finances by </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">giving to us the interest on Bonds they hold together with an additional 10% of
 all the monies </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">collected by them during the year. When in November Westminster Church asked for
 a special </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">collection for its budget, our Society relinquished its claim on the offering of
 the Ladies Society and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">presented it, together with an added donation from our own funds, to the special
 collection of the </span>
