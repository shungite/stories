        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">Isabel Auld, is another member to highlight and acknowledge her contribution to
 the Church and to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">the community. She died in March 2016 She served as chair of the Board of
 Westminster, and was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">active on many committees and belonged to a Circle. Yet, somehow, she managed to
 have a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">active community life, enriching the life of so many in this city. Her faith led
 her to many other ways </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">of enriching our community. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">And we need to recognize the work of woman like Margaret Hodson, who has managed
 the kitchen </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">so well for Westminster in her quiet and effective manner, plus giving and
 supporting the Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">and community in many ways. And the many women who volunteer at the Bell Tower
 Community </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Café. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">Let’s close with a round of applause for the many women who have gone before us, and
 who have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">given us inspiration, and gratitude for the many services rendered to
 Westminster Church, and to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">wider community.</span>

        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:6419.32px;">United Church Women (from the Internet)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7018.92px;">When the United Church officially formed in 1925, the Ladies Aid (LA) (later the
 Woman’s Association </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7369.68px;">(WA)) and the Women’s Missionary Society (WMS) were doing work at home and abroad. The WA </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7720.45px;">focused on supporting the local church and community, while the WMS was more
 involved with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8071.21px;">education and world mission.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8621.98px;">When Westminster congregation was created in 1892 some of the first groups (or
 clubs) to form </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8972.74px;">were Missional in focus, a Women’s Missionary group, a Young Women's Missionary group, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9323.50px;">later a Pitblado Missionary group. The major task of Church outreach was in the
 hands of its women. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9674.27px;">At the same time women of our church continued their traditional roles as
 teachers, fundraisers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10025.04px;">and organizers of social functions, teas and dinners.</span>
