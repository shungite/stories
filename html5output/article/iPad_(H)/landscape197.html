        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">Despite the number of pages in this account of “Westminster Revisited,” I have said nothing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">my involvement with the mission board. In 1965 I was asked to be the conference
 convenor of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Overseas Missions Committee, which, apart from chairing conference committee
 meetings, meant a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">four-day meeting in Toronto each November. It also meant an involvement in the
 Prairie Conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">on World Mission, an ecumenical and international meeting for two days each
 spring of clergy and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">laity from Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Northwestern Ontario, as well as people
 from North and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">South Dakota and Minnesota. Both the national church boards and the cross-border
 ecumenical </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">programs were interesting and, I think, worthwhile.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">The interfaith contacts were also very valuable, especially to meet monthly or
 so with clergy, priests, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">and rabbis in Winnipeg, and to have occasional joint services in synagogues and
 cathedrals. Who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">was it once said, “I don’t like that person,” and his friend replied, “But you don’t know him.” “No,” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">was the response, “and that’s why I don’t like him.” When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Michael </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">Ramsey, was in Winnipeg in 1966, I was the United Church representative who took
 part in the huge </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">service of celebration (thanks to the fact that general council was being held
 at that time and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">president of conference was away). The service was televised nationwide on CBC,
 and as we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">lining up for a very formal procession, I found myself immediately ahead of the
 Knights of Columbus, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">with their sheathed swords. Turning to one of the K of C group, I said that if
 any of the Orange Lodge </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">people from Donegal were to see me on television along with the Knights of
 Columbus, they would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">have a fit! “Well, let’s give them something to talk about then,” he said, unsheathing his sword, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">putting the bare blade dangerously close to my neck!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">There is a sense in which we are still too close to our years at Westminster to
 get a proper perspective </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">on the life and work of the congregation. Suffice it to say that in the midst of
 all the programs and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">special events that we have touched on in these last dozen pages, my own time
 was naturally taken </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">up most of all with Sunday worship and pastoral care. There were many demands on
 one’s time: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">hospital visiting, as much home visiting as it was humanly possible to do,
 funerals, weddings, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">counselling, many long days and many late nights. We were blessed with very
 dedicated and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">competent staff associates, and a vast array of just as dedicated and competent
 lay workers. As </span>
