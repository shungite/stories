        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">of the hundreds of servicemen during World War I who used the spacious gym and
 church hall for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">recreational purposes. Indeed, at one point in those early years, they had a
 pool table in one of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">basement rooms, much to the disgust of the Wednesday evening prayer meeting
 group who prayed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">fervently that “this wicked thing would soon be removed from our premises.” That prayer must have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">been answered, because when the pool table was worn out, it was never replaced.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Shortly after we arrived in 1963, there were discussions about some kind of
 church-sponsored child </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">care on a permanent basis. As early as 1948 or 1949, there had been a weekday
 play school that our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">two-year-old Francie (as the minister’s child) was allowed to attend, though the lower age limit was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">three. But, by 1965, with the active assistance of Mrs. Gretta Brown (daughter
 of the late Charles W. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Gordon—“Ralph Connor”), we looked at the possibility of a lunch and after- school program for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">kindergarten to Grade 3 boys and girls of nearby Mulvey School who were children
 of sole-support </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">working mothers. After a year of planning, getting the program officially
 recognized by the provincial </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">government, and with funding in place by the church, the government and the
 mothers, the project </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">began. Major funding was eventually picked up by the government, with the church
 supplying all the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">facilities and the volunteers. We began with one staff person and twenty-five or
 so children. The </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">program has grown, and for many years has had two workers and forty to fifty
 children. A large </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">group of volunteers assist at meal time. All equipment has been upgraded to
 fulfill the Board of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">Health requirements. Members of the congregation carry most of the
 responsibility for the work of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">the child care board. It is such a well-established program that one couldn’t imagine Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">without it.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">The church sanctuary, halls, and meeting rooms are used by many groups in the
 city. The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">Chamber Orchestra has its four or five concerts each year in the sanctuary, and
 the orchestra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">members use most of the facilities for rehearsing. At times, it was somewhat a
 nuisance, but this was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">offset for me by the personal joy to give over my vestry to many guest artists.
 I remember best of all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">Liona Boyd, Ivan Moravec, Elmer Iseler, and the Canadian Brass.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Several high schools still have their June graduations in the sanctuary. Mrs.
 Litz’s Mennonite </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">Children’s Choir made several of their records in our church. The Winnipeg Ladies Choir,
 mainly a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">Mennonite choir, also used the sanctuary. The acoustics are excellent, and even
 more important, the </span>
