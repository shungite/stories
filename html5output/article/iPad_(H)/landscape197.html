        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">church, but Mr. and Mrs. Flipse occupied the three-room apartment on the fourth
 floor of the church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">hall for many years. Mr. Flipse was quiet, unassuming, very kind, very
 efficient, and, of course, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">extremely capable in terms of the church lawn. His hours were long; he was
 literally on call anytime, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">all the time, from when the doors opened in the morning until the last meeting
 was over at night. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">had Monday evening and all day Tuesday off. His replacement for those times was
 old Mr. Fish. I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">glad he was there, because it made possible my little joke: ours was the only
 church in town that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">employed Fish and Flipse!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Upon returning to Westminster in 1963, we still had a Dutch custodian, Rinke
 Zielstra. Mrs. Zielstra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">helped a good deal, especially in Rinke’s last years when his health was failing. They were succeeded </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">by Mr. and Mrs. Abe Thiessen, who in a year or two, became fed up with the
 sixty-eight steps to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">fourth floor, and moved into their own home nearby. They also pointed out how
 very little private life </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">they had by living in the building where they worked.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">In the church office, Mrs. Violet Ridd had been secretary for eight or ten years
 before our arrival. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">However, a few months into my tenure she suddenly resigned. Mrs. Anna Burt was
 hired to replace </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">her, and for many years she served the church with great efficiency. She had
 been a Scottish war </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">bride, coming to Canada shortly after the war to marry Phil whom she had met
 when they were both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">in the Armed Forces. They had two daughters, Margaret and Anne. Phil was an
 orderly at the Deer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">Lodge Veterans Hospital. Mrs. Burt was extremely efficient, and in short order
 had the office routine </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">down to a science. She was with us till the late seventies, though her
 continuing problem with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">arthritis finally forced her to work from a wheelchair. They bought a van with a
 side-lift to assist in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">transporting her to the church until she reached retirement age. Her long-time
 dream was to tour </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">Nova Scotia. (“I’ve toured all of old Scotland,” she used to say. “Now, if I could only see New </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">Scotland.”) The church’s farewell gift to her was airfare for her and Phil to Halifax, with a
 para-transit </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">van waiting for them to do a two-week tour in the Maritimes. Unfortunately, upon
 arrival back in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">Winnipeg, she suffered a bout of pneumonia, and after being bed-ridden for a few
 weeks, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">arthritis became so severe she had to spend her remaining year and a half in
 bed. After her death, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">Phil began a life of travel, revisiting countries where he had served in WWII.
 He had been a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">patient, caring, and long-serving husband.</span>
