        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Winnipeg friends.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">We had a succession of staff members. When Mack retired, Jack Mathieson, who had
 served in North </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Honan, China, was with us for three years. When Doris Marshall moved to Toronto
 to be near her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">family and to do senior adult programming for the United Church, Susan Cawley
 became our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">deaconess. She was a recent graduate from Covenant College and was with us for
 two years. Susan </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">married Harold Atwell from Trinidad, and when he finished his studies at the
 University of Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">they moved to Trinidad. Glenys Hughes, also from Covenant College, succeeded
 Susan, and less than </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">two years later married Rev. Harry Oussoren and moved back to Toronto. Barbara
 Bryant also came to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">us when she completed her two-year course at Covenant College, but stayed for
 only one year. Upon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">leaving Westminster, Barbara attended Seneca       College in Toronto and graduated in early </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">childhood education. She married a minister and they serve jointly on a pastoral
 charge in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">Saskatchewan.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">When Barbara was leaving, and Jack Mathieson retired, the board decided we
 should move into a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">new staffing arrangement and they called a relatively young ordained minister,
 Cecil Tiller. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">seemed anxious to move west from Saint John, New Brunswick, and to undertake a
 role similar to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">the one that I had earlier done at Westminster, i.e., to be an associate
 minister with major </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">responsibility for Christian education, to do as much visiting as possible, and
 to preach once each </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">month. This arrangement seemed to work well for a year or two, but Cec began to
 realize that he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">really preferred preaching to CE work, and accepted a call to St. Andrew’s Church in Regina after two </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">years at Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">At this point, we changed direction quite considerably in our staffing, and
 decided to hire three staff </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">people working one-third time each. Joan McConnell, who had been a teacher
 before she and Barry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">had four children, was our Sunday school superintendent, and she became our
 director of Christian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">education. Audrey McLennan, who, before she and Norm had their three boys, had
 been a program </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">director at the YWCA, was anxious to get back into part-time work and was happy
 to work one-third </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">time as outreach coordinator. Rev. Bill Conly, just retired after serving all
 his forty years in Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">became our one-third-time retired visiting assistant. The four of us formed a
 very happy working </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">relationship, each with her or his special responsibilities. Bill Conly’s wife, Irene, was one of the </span>
