        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">completed his Theological training and met Lorraine Lareome who was in nursing
 training. They </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">were married in the summer of 1966, and were placed in their first pastorate in
 Morley, a small town </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">between Calgary and Banff, to serve a community of Stoney Indians for two years.
 At the end of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">assigned two years, the elders asked them to stay, but, since an Indian minister
 originally from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">reserve wished to return, they resigned. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">As a result of an application to the United Church Board of World Missions, to
 do missionary work </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">somewhere in Asia, they were assigned to Japan.The first two years were spent in
 Tokyo studying the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">language and doing some counselling with an English Church youth group. In 1970
 they were placed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">in a ‘new town’ area of 130,000 people. The town was a suburb of Osaka — and they could see the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">sight of Expo ‘70 from their window. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">Here, from 1970 to 1975, Bob worked with a a Japanese Senior minister. Because
 the new towns had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">policy of “no church buildings” Bob organized the third “house church” — the congregation meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">in a rented hall. Because the building was used for other purposes during the
 week, Bob’s car trunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">became the storage area for the pulpit, the church library and tapes with the
 hymns and speakers to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">play them through. Each Sunday’s worship was preceded by a rapid few moments of furniture </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">moving! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">At Christmas, 1975, Bob was called to St. Andrews-Wesley in Vancouver* as an
 assistant minister </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">responsible for Outreach and Christian Education. During his one year furlough
 from Japan, he had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">worked there while taking training in high-rise apartment ministry.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">And now the Thompsons have come to the Prairies with their three children;
 Jillian-11, Amanda-5, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">and Joshua who arrived on July 19th adding a further challenge to the already
 horrendous task of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">moving from Vancouver to Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">The official induction of the Rev. Robert Thompson as our minister will take
 place in our Church on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">Sunday, October 14 at 7:30 PM with members of Presbytery officiating.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-29.49px;top:9585.95px;">*More recently St Andrews-Wesley has been the home church of Rev. Gary Paterson,
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">United Church Moderator.</span>
