        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">And so we find that here at Westminster the amalgamation of the Women’s Missionary Society and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">the Women’s Association, coming together in the early 1960s and created 19 women’s groups with a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">mandate to involve more women in church activities. The inaugural service of the
 newly formed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">Westminster UCW was organized by Marilyn Huband in October 1962.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">(See UCW Scrapbook items at the end of this article.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">These women’s groups, later known as ‘Women’s Units,’ were part of Westminster life for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">decades — creating opportunities for social interaction and raising money for specific
 projects such as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">knitting sweaters, packaging baby layettes, purchasing supplies for baby quilts
 (all to be sent to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Buelah Burns mission in China) and filling Christmas hampers. The Units were
 responsible not only </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">for organizing church luncheons, bazaars and study groups, but also for
 coordinating after-church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">fellowship coffee time. Every spring, all units would get together for a Potluck
 Supper and an evening </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">of socializing and fellowship at the church. At one such event, the ladies
 presented a bridal fashion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">show, organized by Jo Brown, where a number of the younger members paraded
 merrily through the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">pot-luck crowd in their wedding gowns.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">Long-lasting friendships have been formed over the years and members continue to
 play a hugely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">important role in the organization and support of many church programs and
 events. I was able to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">track down some background about 3 of the units: Unit 6, 10 and 13. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">Unit 13, formed by Marilyn Huband in 1962, had the distinction of being known as
 the ‘Professional </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Women’s Group’ and thus always met in the evenings. Unit 13 was famous for its Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">Mincemeat — an initiative begun by its founder and leader. Every November the members of the
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">group and other volunteers brought together all the ingredients to make this
 wonderful Christmas </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">treat as a fundraiser for the Church. As of last year, the Choir will be
 continuing this tradition. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">Unit 6, begun in 1968 by Mary Leithead, was known as the ‘Young Women’s Unit.’ Mrs. Leithead </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">graciously hosted this fledgling group in her own home for monthly meetings
 during the first year </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">until they were comfortable to meet in each other’s homes. Thanks to Pat Miles, we have some </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">written memories of some of the memories of Unit 6, from Nancy Finley, Pat
 Roberts, Allison </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">Kennedy and Joan Wilton and I’d like to share those of Nancy Finley: </span>
