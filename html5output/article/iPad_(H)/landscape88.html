 However, beyond </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">they established New York’s first free schools which later became the city’s public school system. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">They have had a vigorous program of relief work among the poor and homeless in
 the city. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">And they boast, on their website of having started Dial-a-Prayer.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Enter John Sutherland Bonnell, stage right!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">His sermons at Fifth Avenue were regularly reported each week in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:9676.00px;top:2822.95px;">New York Times</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:11720.49px;top:2822.95px;">. The topics </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">he preached on were similar to those heard by Westminster’s congregation including his fears </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">of communist Russia and its negative effect on religious worship. For example
 excerpts from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">his Fifth Avenue sermon, Has Russia Banished God.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:4426.01px;">“History has witnessed many attempts to abolish religion and banish God. My text
 for this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">morning refers to one of these. Antiochus Epiphanes, who became the King of
 Syria in the year </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">175 B.C. undertook the subjugation of Palestine. It was his policy to conquer
 and Hellenized </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">as much of the world as possible.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">The Greek King made a surprise attack upon Jerusalem and captured the city.
 After having massacred </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">many of its inhabitants, he established his military forces within the temple
 area and declared that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">Jewish religious observances were illegal. All sacrifice was abolished. The
 sacred books were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">destroyed; and even Sabbath observance was prohibited.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">But the crowning indignity of all was committed by Antiochus, when, in
 December168 B.C., he set up </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">an altar to a pagan deity in the heart of the temple and then, to complete the
 desecration in the eyes </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">of the Jews, he sacrificed swine upon that altar. This was the abomination that
 maketh desolate. So </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">great was the indignation of the Hebrew people that the Maccabees, the father
 and his five sons, led </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">a spontaneous uprising against the King, who, when he saw his purpose
 frustrated, went mad, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">died shortly thereafter.”</span>
