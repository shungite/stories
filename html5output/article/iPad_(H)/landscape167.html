        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="">Nancy Finley’s memories:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:599.60px;">“My first memory of our Unit is of the phone ringing in my kitchen and when I
 answered it was Mary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:950.36px;">Leithead from Westminster United Church (WUC). She was asking me to come out to
 a Unit meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1301.13px;">the next Wednesday at her house. My question to all and sundry is: how do you
 say no to Mary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1651.89px;">Leithead? I wanted to, that’s for sure. A Unit (or Circle) was something my Mother had belonged to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2002.66px;">and was meant for her age group. I told Mary I had Meaghan (3 months old at the
 time) and really </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2353.42px;">couldn’t see my way to join any group. Dave and I had been married at WUC and maybe
 attended a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2704.19px;">few Sunday services, but that was all.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3254.95px;">Mary being Mary laughed and told me to bring Meaghan (said lots did) and that
 she would ask a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3605.71px;">lovely lady by the name of Joan Brathwaite (now Joan Wilton) to pick me up. It
 was settled, I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3956.48px;">going.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4507.24px;">Joan picked me up and WAS a lovely lady. I remember thinking that if the rest of
 the group was this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4858.01px;">nice, great, the evening would be fine. The evening was fun, chatting with women
 in the same boat </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5208.77px;">as me. Trying to live a Christian life while raising kids and dealing with life’s adventures.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5759.54px;">It wasn’t that long before we (as a group) decided to look after the nursery Sunday
 school, thusly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6110.30px;">meeting more of our Church members and becoming involved. I have a clear memory
 of making </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:6461.07px;">‘fancy’ sandwiches at Lorrie’s house for the Annual Fall Bazaar (maybe it was the spring tea) and that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6811.83px;">skill has served me well through the years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7362.60px;">As a group we were definitely each other’s significant others when the need arose. This has proven </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7713.36px;">true to this day. We are so lucky. But mostly I remember having fun. Dinners
 with the Husbands </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8064.13px;">(once again at Lorrie’s house — she had the largest home at the time or was the first to volunteer to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8414.89px;">host). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8965.66px;">I truly believe that because of Unit I, became more involved with WUC. We all
 did. We welcomed new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9316.42px;">members to our group and said goodbye to others. We chose studies that were
 relevant to our lives </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9667.19px;">and shared thoughts and feelings this way.”</span>
