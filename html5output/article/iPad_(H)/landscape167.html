        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4923.56px;">The original founding members of the Kids’ Choir were Scott Arnould, Daniel and Leila Boch-</span>

 Paul Taylor and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5625.09px;">Amanda Tiwari. We met upstairs every Sunday 9:30 to 10:00 from Sept to May. The Membership </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5975.86px;">ranged from six to twelve singers over the next fifteen years. We sang once a month during the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6326.62px;">worship service and always at the early Christmas Eve service as well as many
 musicals over the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6677.39px;">years. We also were invited to sing at services at Riverview, Lions Place, and
 Poseidon Centre and a </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7929.68px;">There was an old upright piano at the beginning which was replaced by a lovely
 piano received from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8280.45px;">the estate of Donald Smith in 2005. It was always lovely to hear the young
 voices gain confidence and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8631.21px;">strength during the year. At least two of the members, Robert McMahon and James
 Campbell went on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8981.98px;">to study voice as adults. Glen Harrison, the Senior Choir and the congregation
 were always so </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9332.74px;">supportive and encouraging. On two occasions we were invited to sing a combined
 anthem with the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9683.50px;">Senior Choir which was a huge thrill for the kids. These are the musicals
