        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Women were part of many activities of the Church, singing in the Choir, teaching
 Sunday School and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">leading youth groups, such as Canadian Girls in Training. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">One of the groups of women that has continued over most of Westminster’s 125 years is the Sewing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Circle, becoming the Quilting Group, and more recently, including a knitting
 group. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1770.66px;">Through many decades this group provided hundreds of quilts, layettes, afghans,
 knitted hats, mitts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">and scarves to those in need, all over the world. For example, in 1937, 25
 quilts given to the needy, in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">1942, 26quilts and 48 warm garments shipped overseas and another 6 quilts sent
 to fresh air camps. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">In 1943, 30 quilts and afghans sent to the Red Cross to be part of their victory
 bundles and 19 layettes </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">and many knitted garments were distributed in Winnipeg. Westminster women sent
 their crafted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">items to Europe, Korea, Angola, and to small Northern communities in norther
 Manitoba, and locally </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">to the Xmas cheer board, Stella Ave Mission and as close to home as Mulvey
 School. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">Recently, knitting became the activity of choice for many volunteers, working at
 home and in church. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">They have continued to produce mitts, scarves etc. for the Christmas season
 mitten tree. Another </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">group of knitters was formed in 2005 to produce prayer shawls.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">A few historic names have been recorded of the women taking part in this
 activity over the years. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">One person, Mrs. James McKenzie set a record in 1966 when she turned in 39 pairs
 of men’s socks — </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">at the age of 99! Another, Mrs. Dorothy Russell was the leader of the group in
 1990 but has been a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">quilter since 1955, a service record of 35 years. Names of participants which
 might resonate with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">some Westminster familieQuilters 1 copys to this day were Ruby Storey, Emma
 McIvor, Eleanor </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">Connolly, Alma MacFarlane, Jessie Bragg, Jessie Riddell, Barb Duval, Nancy
 Defoe, Lorna Esdale, Kay </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">Flood, Carol McBride, Marjorie Robers, Winnie Christie, Sonia Wright and more
 recently Grace Aoki. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">I encourage all of you to take a look at the quilts framed and hanging in the
 washrooms at the back </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">of the Church. The larger piece is The Lorna Waddington Quilt, and dates from
 the 1930’s, a gift at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">that time to Lorna (Esdale) Waddington. Lorna passed it on to the women of the
 Westminster United </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">Church Quilting group who used these antique pieced blocks to create a quilt to
 hang in the narthex </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">of the Church. The quilt was hung on Thursday, January 18, 2007.</span>
