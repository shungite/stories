        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">made his decision to go east for his university work. We certainly didn’t need this huge manse. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Dorothy was already on part-time staff at Laura Second as teacher-librarian,
 having taken the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">necessary five courses at U of M. A smaller home would suit us better. It would
 also give us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1019.89px;">opportunity to get some equity in a house, so that upon retirement we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1370.66px;">wouldn’t simply leave the keys on the kitchen counter and face the prospect of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1721.42px;">having to buy a home at that late stage.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2272.19px;">I spoke to some of the people on the board who had been around for years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2622.95px;">about buying our own house, although I assured them that if the congregation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2973.72px;">felt strongly about retaining its manse we could no doubt accommodate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3324.48px;">ourselves to their decision. Fortunately, the church board was very happy to get
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3675.25px;">out of the property business. The manse was sold. We purchased a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4026.01px;">suitable three-bedroom bungalow at 718 Waterloo Street, and one of Rob’s last </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4376.77px;">jobs at home before going to U of T was to help us with the back-breaking job </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">of moving our goods and chattels just five blocks down the street.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">We hired movers, of course, to move the piano, living room and bedroom furniture
 and appliances, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">but did the rest ourselves. And we did it all in one day, June 30, 1971. The
 people from whom we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">bought didn’t move out till June 29, and the people who bought 141 wanted to move in on July
 1. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">With a rented two-wheel trailer, and the help of some of Rob’s friends with a station wagon, we made </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">an untold number of trips up and down Waterloo Street. Loads of books, the
 bricks and boards from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">our homemade shelves, all our dishes (packed by Dorothy), all our clothes still
 on hangers, bedding, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">pictures off the walls, plants in their pots, groceries from the shelves, lawn
 mower and wheel barrow </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">and stepladder... and the list goes on. We took the last trailer load at
 midnight. Dorothy had made up </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">the beds in our new home. And I set the alarm for 7:30 a.m. so I could return
 the rented trailer at 8 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">a.m. the next morning! It was small comfort to have the new owners of 141 come
 by that evening as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">we were frantically trying to finish our hectic day’s work to assure us that there really was no hurry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">after all. They had decided to have some redecoration done, and the painters
 weren’t coming for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">several days. Oh well, you can’t win ‘em all.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">I like to add footnotes, and this time there are two. First, don’t ever try to do your own moving, even </span>
