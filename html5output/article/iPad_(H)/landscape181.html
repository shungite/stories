        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">from all that “Christmas cheer.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">During the 4th season from the public platform over 50 addresses (speeeches)
 were given to outside </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">organizations and a program of service was launched to country churches. The
 club also held an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-23.95px;top:1219.89px;">‘undenominational’ mass meeting in April to 4000 people.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1770.66px;">In 1933 the club, with the help of the YMCA organized “two memorable mass meetings, the principal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2121.42px;">speaker being Dr. Sherwood Eddy. (This event is mentioned in the article on Dr.
 Bonnell.) Leslie </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">indicates that over 6000 people attended. Here, the writer has to recognize that
 Leslie Hunt was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">strong on hyperbole but short on simple honest mathematics. In two meetings he
 would have us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">believe that over 6000 people (seated in Westminster's sanctuary and in the
 Tivoli Theatre across the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Street) attended this momentous event. I don't believe it. Too many people and
 not enough space!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">In the event the club thrived till well into the 40s when WWII called away young
 men for service </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">overseas.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">This picture of the Club’s 1934 executive includes a number of names of people who became </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5327.54px;">prominent in Winnipeg in later years. Two names that immediately spring to mind
 are Gurzon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">Harvey who served on Winnipeg’s City Council for 26 years. The other is Aiden Conklin, 35 years as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">School Trustee in St. James, Reeve of the Municipality of Victoria Beach,
 recipient of the Queen </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal for Community service in 1977 and an inductee
 into The Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">Order of The Buffalo Hunt in 1980. Aiden’s daughter Liz Wijtkamp is presently an active member of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">Westminster Church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:7622.38px;">R.D. — In His Own Words</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8221.98px;">R.D. (Bert) Macfarlane represents a significant portion of the congregation
 which has always been the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">back bone of a successful Church- dedicated volunteers; the tireless men and
 women who  run our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">programs and shoulder responsibilities for — among many reasons — the joy of serving. R.D. worked  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9274.27px;">in our Sunday School and our Athletic program for young people. He edited a
 newsletter for many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9625.04px;">years. He also fathered a girl who became, like himself, a leader every bit as
 strong as her father; </span>
