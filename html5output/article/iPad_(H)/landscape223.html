        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Apparently, someone from Britain was visiting Westminster that day and showed
 PUNCH the </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1458.97px;">The Westminster Children's Care Centre was established in 1965 in answer to a
 real and urgent need </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1809.74px;">in the community served by Westminster Church.Under the leadership of Dr. George
 Sisler  the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2160.50px;">agency was chartered under the Manitoba Companies Act as an independent,  non-profit, non-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2511.27px;">sectarian, organization existing primarily to conduct a day-care program for the
 children of working </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2862.03px;">mothers.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3412.80px;">A Committee was formed with Mr. Justice James (Jimmy) Wilson as the Chair, of
 the committee. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3763.56px;">Officers were: Bob Peeler, Vice chair (later-Chair); Tom Smith, Treasurer; Trudy
 Perkins, Director; and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4114.33px;">Lorraine Perkins, Assistant Director. Other members of the Committee (as of
 1973): M. Leithead, M. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4465.09px;">Armstrong, C. Lamont, R. Friesen, M. Brown, H. Badger, I. Lees and Dr. Murray
 Campbell.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5015.86px;">Originally the Centre was open to children (Grades 1 to 6) of single moms.
 Practically, it was open to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5366.62px;">the children of single parents, mothers or fathers of children at Mulvey School.
 It was open during </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5717.39px;">the "school year", but not on holidays (Christmas, Easter and the Summer.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6268.15px;">Then, under the Day Care Act , 1986 , it was operated with a Board of Directors,
 a formal budget a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6618.92px;">Director and Staff under a set of rules and regulations.  Church people were still involved both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6969.68px;">creating lunches and snacks, and with volunteers meeting the kids from school to
 lunch at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7320.45px;">church and back again and again at close of school day. Volunteers also sat with
 them and chatted </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7671.21px;">during lunch hours. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8221.98px;">In 1995 it was incorporated as a Government agency. The Centre can handle 50
 children. Twelve </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8572.74px;">spaces are reserved for children ages 4 and 5. They come to the Centre before
 school (nursery and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8923.50px;">Kindergarten)  in the morning, have breakfast and are then taken to school by staff. They are
 then </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9274.27px;">picked up by stafff at 11:30, returned to the Centre and given lunch. They then
 stay at the Centre till </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9625.04px;">they are picked up by their parents after work.</span>
