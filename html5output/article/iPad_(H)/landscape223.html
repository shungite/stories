        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">but generally maintains the same level of attendance all year. There are no more
 volunteers and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">therefore no more direct participation of the Westminster congregation in the
 operation. The total </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">paid staff under Director Greg Blanco, is trained and professional.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">The  Staff sets a monthly meal plan (based on Canada food guide), does the shopping
 for groceries, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">and prepares and serves breakfast, lunch and after school snacks. The cost of
 the food program is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">approximately $13,000/annum . Food is prepared i the Church's basement kitchen
 and the children </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">eat in the area we know as our gymnasium.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">The program offered to the children is Government stipulated; "Children should
 learn through play" </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">at the Centre. Learning through play is an age-old concept but sometimes
 misunderstood; we often </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">believe that play is play but learning is work.  However, public school, kindergarten and nursery </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">school teachers will tell you how directed experience in the child’s environment can still be play and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">yet have structure and purpose. The Staff of the Centre  is challenged as much as classroom teachers </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">are dealing with children who have different levels of development, experience
 and ability even </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">within a play environment.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">The Centre, then, becomes  an integral part of the children's development and works to develop </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">cooperation with the children's school and with their parents. To make the
 point; the Centre is not a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">holding facility for children whose parents are at work. It is part of
 children's development, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">intellectually and socially. A far cry today from when Westminster started an
 out-reach activity to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">relieve pressure on working parents.</span>
