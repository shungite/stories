        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="left:3599.99px;top:360.00px;">Westminster’s Most Famous Preacher</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-19" style="left:3599.99px;top:992.00px;">Part One</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3558.98px;top:1543.60px;">“I grew up in Charlottetown and left school in 1908 when I was 15 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:1894.36px;">before completing Grade 8. I was thoroughly bored by the subjects taught </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:2245.12px;">in the public school. The only subject that interested me was public </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:2595.89px;">speaking at which I quite excelled. An education past public school </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:2946.65px;">was not seen as a necessity in those days and my parents realized </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:3297.42px;">that I was not accomplishing much” (Bonnell).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:3848.18px;">At 17 Bonnell got a job at Falconwood (a psychiatric hospital) where his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:4198.95px;">father worked as a Supervisor. A man, E.O. Brown, tried for embezzlement, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3599.99px;top:4549.71px;">found insane, and incarcerated in Falconwood became the young Bonnell’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4900.48px;">personal charge whom he had to attend daily during exercise periods etc. They
 became friends. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5251.24px;">During his time with Brown, Bonnell came to se that the man had a brilliant (not
 insane) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5602.01px;">mind and was well educated.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6152.77px;">When Bonnell decided he wanted to enter the ministry, matriculation from
 secondary school was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6503.54px;">not a prerequisite to entering college. However, he realized that the college
 entrance exams would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6854.30px;">require more of him than he had learned in school.When he set about educating
 himself he became </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7205.07px;">aware that Brown might be a valuable tutor for him. As it turned out their
 relationship did take the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7555.83px;">form of student and tutor rather than minder and inmate. Bonnell asserted that
 Brown's subsequent </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7906.60px;">help enabled the young man to write and successfully pass the entrance exams and
 begin his </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8257.36px;">education at Prince of Wales College.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8808.13px;">From Prince of Wales Bonnell went on to study at Dalhousie University and then
 took his theological </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9158.89px;">training at Pine Hill Divinity Hall, Nova Scotia. While at Dalhousie, he
 interrupted his studies to enlist </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9509.66px;">in the Canadian Army in WW I. During his service he was twice wounded and, after
 suffering from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9860.42px;">gas poisoning, was sent home. (His friend, Brown, whom Bonnell eventually helped
 escape from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10211.19px;">Falconwood and enlist in the army was killed in action in France.)</span>
