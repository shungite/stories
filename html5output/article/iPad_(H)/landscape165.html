        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">fellowship coffee time. Every spring, all units would get together for a Potluck
 Supper and an evening </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">of socializing and fellowship at the church. At one such event, the ladies
 presented a bridal fashion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">show, organized by Jo Brown, where a number of the younger members paraded
 merrily through the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">pot-luck crowd in their wedding gowns.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Long-lasting friendships have been formed over the years and members continue to
 play a hugely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">important role in the organization and support of many church programs and
 events. I was able to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">track down some background about 3 of the units: Unit 6, 10 and 13. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Unit 13, formed by Marilyn Huband in 1962, had the distinction of being known as
 the ‘Professional </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">Women’s Group’ and thus always met in the evenings. Unit 13 was famous for its Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Mincemeat — an initiative begun by its founder and leader. Every November the members of the
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">group and other volunteers brought together all the ingredients to make this
 wonderful Christmas </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">treat as a fundraiser for the Church. As of last year, the Choir will be
 continuing this tradition. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Unit 6, begun in 1968 by Mary Leithead, was known as the ‘Young Women’s Unit.’ Mrs. Leithead </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">graciously hosted this fledgling group in her own home for monthly meetings
 during the first year </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">until they were comfortable to meet in each other’s homes. Thanks to Pat Miles, we have some </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">written memories of some of the memories of Unit 6, from Nancy Finley, Pat
 Roberts, Allison </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">Kennedy and Joan Wilton and I’d like to share those of Nancy Finley: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:6720.85px;">Nancy Finley’s memories:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:7320.45px;">“My first memory of our Unit is of the phone ringing in my kitchen and when I
 answered it was Mary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7671.21px;">Leithead from Westminster United Church (WUC). She was asking me to come out to
 a Unit meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8021.98px;">the next Wednesday at her house. My question to all and sundry is: how do you
 say no to Mary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8372.74px;">Leithead? I wanted to, that’s for sure. A Unit (or Circle) was something my Mother had belonged to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8723.50px;">and was meant for her age group. I told Mary I had Meaghan (3 months old at the
 time) and really </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9074.27px;">couldn’t see my way to join any group. Dave and I had been married at WUC and maybe
 attended a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9425.04px;">few Sunday services, but that was all.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9975.80px;">Mary being Mary laughed and told me to bring Meaghan (said lots did) and that
 she would ask a </span>
