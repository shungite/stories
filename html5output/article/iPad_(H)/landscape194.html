        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">was to help us with the back-breaking job of moving our goods and chattels just
 five blocks down the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">street.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">We hired movers, of course, to move the piano, living room and bedroom furniture
 and appliances, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">but did the rest ourselves. And we did it all in one day, June 30, 1971. The
 people from whom we </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">bought didn’t move out till June 29, and the people who bought 141 wanted to move in on July
 1. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">With a rented two-wheel trailer, and the help of some of Rob’s friends with a station wagon, we made </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">an untold number of trips up and down Waterloo Street. Loads of books, the
 bricks and boards from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">our homemade shelves, all our dishes (packed by Dorothy), all our clothes still
 on hangers, bedding, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">pictures off the walls, plants in their pots, groceries from the shelves, lawn
 mower and wheel barrow </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">and stepladder... and the list goes on. We took the last trailer load at
 midnight. Dorothy had made up </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">the beds in our new home. And I set the alarm for 7:30 a.m. so I could return
 the rented trailer at 8 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">a.m. the next morning! It was small comfort to have the new owners of 141 come
 by that evening as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">we were frantically trying to finish our hectic day’s work to assure us that there really was no hurry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">after all. They had decided to have some redecoration done, and the painters
 weren’t coming for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">several days. Oh well, you can’t win ‘em all.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">I like to add footnotes, and this time there are two. First, don’t ever try to do your own moving, even </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">if it is only five blocks away. And, second, we certainly didn’t realize at the time how extremely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">fortunate we were to have purchased our home when we did. We bought 718 Waterloo
 in 1971 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">$23,900, and, exactly ten years later, sold it for $67,000. What a boon to have
 cash in hand to buy our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">retirement home in London, a much better home in every way, and almost
 completely paid for by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">sale of 718 Waterloo.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">There were at least two important decisions regarding property and finances made
 by the trustees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">and board at Westminster in our time there. First, the old manse at 120 Maryland
 Street was being </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">used by Manitoba conference as the office for the conference staff and the
 resource centre. (141 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">Waterloo had been bought as a manse in about 1958.) After fairly lengthy
 negotiations with the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">conference executive, Westminster agreed to tear down the old manse and build a
 two-storey office </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">building to serve the conference needs. This was accomplished in 1964. The
 conference rent is used </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">to pay off the $80,000 mortgage on the office building, so it has been a win-win
 situation for the </span>
