        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">their wills. I knew that other churches had such a fund, including Knox in
 Winnipeg which had the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Duval Foundation, named for its first minister.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">After much discussion, the idea got off the ground. A constitution was drawn up.
 It went through the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">proper channels in the provincial government so that it was legally chartered.
 Within a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">years, two or three $10,000–$15,000 bequests were given. When the manse was sold (for a mere </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">$38,000 in those years), that money was put in. Except in unusual circumstances,
 only the interest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">was to be used, and, even then, only for special expenses. In our years, most of
 the very fine stained-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">glass windows were cleaned and re-leaded using interest from the Foundation
 Fund. By the time of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">my retirement in 1979, the foundation stood at well over $100,000. The 1991
 Annual Report shows </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">$300,000. Capital grants have been given to put a new roof on the church and to
 renew the heating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">system. I understand that interest from the fund is being used to underwrite
 some of the expenses of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">the 1992 centennial year observances. Perhaps our airfare to the centennial is
 being paid from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">interest on the fund which I so strongly urged the board to establish!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">I should mention, too, establishing the chapel. In both Edmonton and Regina,
 there was a separate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">chapel, so useful when you have a large sanctuary. Many smaller wedding and
 funeral services were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">conducted in the chapel. But there simply didn’t seem to be any suitable location for such a facility at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">Westminster, unless we used either the church parlour, always called the Ladies
 Parlour, or the so-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">called primary room which was a multi-purpose room used for Sunday school, the
 library, counting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">offering on Sunday, quilting every Thursday, and for various committee meetings.
 After some tactful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">discussion with the UCW, it was planned to use the parlour. We would have chairs
 instead of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">permanent pews. There would be a drape (on a track) behind the communion table
 and lectern and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">organ that could be pulled around to the front of the chancel area to make the
 chapel a meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">room, and all would be well. A young architect with a good sense of what we
 desired did our design </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">work. Sufficient families gave memorial contributions to cover the $18,000 cost;
 and Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">now has a most attractive chapel which seats sixty or seventy people. By
 interesting coincidence, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">first of many funerals I conducted in the chapel was that young architect’s aunt (one of the Riddell </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">family). The second funeral was for the mother of Ted Millman, chairman of the
 chapel building </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">committee. There have been many weddings, including Doug and Jane’s on August 25, 1972. We have </span>
