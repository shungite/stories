        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">3) Eric Rivera and his wife, Indrani Ospina and 4 sons had fled Columbia, South
 America in 1997. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Their journey to Canada was filled with terror and uncertainty. They were living
 in Winnipeg. On </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">April 22, 2002 they came to Westminster United Church asking for financial help.
 Their application </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">with Immigration Canada was due to run out on June 30th, 2002 and it cost
 $1300.00 for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">application. With the support of the Outreach Committee the money was given to
 them from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Refugee Fund. They have remained in Winnipeg and went on to be excellent
 Canadian citizens.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">The Refugee Committee was recreated again in April, 2014. Phyllis Reader was the
 chair and Val </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">McIntyre was her assistant. (Val at left)They created an application form for “family reunification” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">sponsorship with Westminster United Church. The rationale was the church would
 not be financially </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">responsible for the refugee but the requesting applicant would take full
 responsibility for their family </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">member. The Betty Halstead Refugee Fund would act as a slush fund if needed. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">There were several applicants. Phyllis and Val did interviews with recorded
 notes. In all cases the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">applicants proved not to be appropriate for the mandate of the committee.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">The committee is on hold at the present time due to the financial and
 ministerial circumstances of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">the church.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">This report is written for the sole purpose of information and archival material
 on Refugee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">Sponsorships at Westminster United Church over the years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:-56.00px;top:6930.60px;">—with our thanks to Phyllis Reader who provided this text.</span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8071.21px;">Some things are hard to pin down. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8621.98px;">For example: when did the Young Men's Club get started?</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9172.74px;">We have a report from 1912 (E.B Dearmond, President and T.S. Hamilton,
 Secretary) which suggests </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9523.50px;">that the Young Men’s Club had been in existence for some time — “A number of new members have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9874.27px;">been added, and the old ones knit more closely together …”</span>
