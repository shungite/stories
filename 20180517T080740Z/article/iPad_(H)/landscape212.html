        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">congregation. I was really impressed with the way in which a structure, or
 system of government, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">can change the life of a church. For many years, the congregation seemed to be
 pulled in three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">directions by the Session, by the UCW, and by the Stewards. Now, there was only
 one board. There </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1019.89px;">were no financial secrets tucked away in the Stewards’ safekeeping. There was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1370.66px;">no Session, so any members of the congregation could be, and were, asked to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:1721.42px;">serve the elements on Communion Sunday. The UCW had no secret agenda, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2072.19px;">because there was no UCW! The units were still meeting, but they came under </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2422.95px;">the fellowship committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:2773.72px;">the visitation was arranged by the membership and visiting committee. And, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3124.48px;">best of all, we were finding new people every year to become board members, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3475.25px;">and all the board members were aware of all the work in the church. In short, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:3826.01px;">we became a much more open society. And with this new breath of fresh air </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4176.77px;">blowing in the church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief reason, I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:3028.40px;top:4527.54px;">think, why I found it easy to continue on at Westminster for a few more years, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4878.30px;">and eventually till retirement when I reached age sixty-five in 1979.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">There were changes in our household, too. Doug, who had enrolled in Grade 9 at
 River Heights Junior </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">High when we came to Winnipeg in 1963, went on to Kelvin High and then to do his
 BA at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">University of Winnipeg, graduating with the gold medal for highest standing in
 the general arts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">course. He had worked each summer (on the end of a hoe) at the University of
 Manitoba farm, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">had a bank account to go to York University in Toronto in the fall of 1970 to
 pursue a PhD in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">psychology. So, in our huge manse at 141 Waterloo Street (3,200 square feet of
 floor space and a 100 × </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">150 foot property), we were down to one family member at home. Rob had proceeded
 through </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">elementary, junior high, and was now (1970–1971) in his final year at Kelvin High School and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8235.19px;">made his decision to go east for his university work. We certainly didn’t need this huge manse. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8585.95px;">Dorothy was already on part-time staff at Laura Second as teacher-librarian,
 having taken the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8936.72px;">necessary five courses at U of M. A smaller home would suit us better. It would
 also give us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9287.48px;">opportunity to get some equity in a house, so that upon retirement we wouldn’t simply leave the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9638.25px;">keys on the kitchen counter and face the prospect of having to buy a home at
 that late stage.</span>
