        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">organists and choir directors, Westminster has had superlative music throughout
 its long history. In </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">our years, Glen Harrison directed many special choir recitals, and on numerous
 occasions had a half </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">dozen Winnipeg Symphony players for orchestral accompaniment. Don Menzies, as
 well as guest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">organists, have played (and broadcast) many recitals. I have heard both Marcel
 Dupré and E. Power </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Biggs in recital on that outstanding instrument.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Writing this much about staff, I’ll also add a word here about our custodians. When we were first at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Westminster, Mr. Jake Flipse looked after the church. A native of Holland, he
 had worked with a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">landscape gardening company when he first came to Canada. I’m not sure when he came to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">church, but Mr. and Mrs. Flipse occupied the three-room apartment on the fourth
 floor of the church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">hall for many years. Mr. Flipse was quiet, unassuming, very kind, very
 efficient, and, of course, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">extremely capable in terms of the church lawn. His hours were long; he was
 literally on call anytime, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">all the time, from when the doors opened in the morning until the last meeting
 was over at night. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">had Monday evening and all day Tuesday off. His replacement for those times was
 old Mr. Fish. I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">glad he was there, because it made possible my little joke: ours was the only
 church in town that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">employed Fish and Flipse!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Upon returning to Westminster in 1963, we still had a Dutch custodian, Rinke
 Zielstra. Mrs. Zielstra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">helped a good deal, especially in Rinke’s last years when his health was failing. They were succeeded </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">by Mr. and Mrs. Abe Thiessen, who in a year or two, became fed up with the
 sixty-eight steps to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">fourth floor, and moved into their own home nearby. They also pointed out how
 very little private life </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">they had by living in the building where they worked.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">In the church office, Mrs. Violet Ridd had been secretary for eight or ten years
 before our arrival. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">However, a few months into my tenure she suddenly resigned. Mrs. Anna Burt was
 hired to replace </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">her, and for many years she served the church with great efficiency. She had
 been a Scottish war </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">bride, coming to Canada shortly after the war to marry Phil whom she had met
 when they were both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">in the Armed Forces. They had two daughters, Margaret and Anne. Phil was an
 orderly at the Deer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Lodge Veterans Hospital. Mrs. Burt was extremely efficient, and in short order
 had the office routine </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">down to a science. She was with us till the late seventies, though her
 continuing problem with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">arthritis finally forced her to work from a wheelchair. They bought a van with a
 side-lift to assist in </span>
