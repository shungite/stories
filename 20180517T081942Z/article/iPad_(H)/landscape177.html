        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:-56.00px;top:599.60px;">— text of a Presentation given by Mary Scott on the occasion of Westminster’s 125th Anniversary.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1150.36px;">Good morning! Thank you Sherri for letting me have some time this morning, as
 part of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1501.13px;">Celebrations for the 125th Anniversary of Westminster Church. It’s a pleasure to be with you </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1851.89px;">this morning and to be part of the service and to share some special history.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2402.66px;">When I heard Roy Halstead speak, probably about a year ago, about plans for the
 125th Anniversary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2753.42px;">Year, and inviting contributions, I immediately thought of Babs Friesen, a
 wonderful friend and long </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3104.19px;">time member of the Church, who had urged me to get more involved in church life,
 and certainly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3454.95px;">Westminster was a meaningful part of her very active life in the community. She
 worked for social </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3805.71px;">justice on many fronts, belonging to many groups and organizations and received
 numerous awards </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4156.48px;">including the Order of Canada and Y Women of Distinction. I just had to tell the
 stories of women </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4507.24px;">from Westminster, how they made and continue to make, a difference to the Church
 and to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4858.01px;">larger community. I spoke to Roy right then and there, and appreciate his
 support and that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5208.77px;">of the Anniversary committee.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5759.54px;">But it hasn’t been an easy task! There have been many written reports to read, and emails
 and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6110.30px;">suggestions from many of our members, for which I am grateful. I have been quite
 inspired by all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6461.07px;">of it. I’ve tried to keep this to under 20 minutes, but have a longer paper that can be
 available </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6811.83px;">to those interested. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7362.60px;">First a brief history. It was in the fall of 1892 when eighteen members of St.
 Andrew’s Presbyterian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7713.36px;">Church discussed the possibility of forming a more centrally located
 congregation for the growing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8064.13px;">community. Permission was granted and the work of establishing a new church
 began: its first </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8414.89px;">service was held on 1 January 1893 in Victoria Hall, later the Winnipeg Theatre,
 on Notre Dame </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8765.66px;">Avenue, attended by more than 200 people. A few days later, the new congregation
 chose the name </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:9116.42px;">“Westminster” and construction of the permanent church at Notre Dame Avenue and Charlotte
 Street </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9467.19px;">commenced. First services were held in the new church on 31 December 1893.
 Formal dedication </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9817.95px;">services followed on 5 and 12 August 1894. By this time a women’s foreign mission society was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10168.72px;">active. In the early years of World War I Westminster was active in several
 fields: three missionaries </span>
