        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:1619.89px;">Bob and Lorraine and children came to us in 1979 after Reid and Dorothy Vipond
 moved east. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:1970.66px;">Following is material written in September of that year by Betty Halstead when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:2321.42px;">she was Vice Chair of the Board:</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2872.19px;">The Thompsons are both natives of Alberta. Bob earned an Education degree in
 Calgary and then </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3222.95px;">moved to St. Stephen’s College in Edmonton. Here, two things affected the direction of his life: he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3573.72px;">completed his Theological training and met Lorraine Lareome who was in nursing
 training. They </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3924.48px;">were married in the summer of 1966, and were placed in their first pastorate in
 Morley, a small town </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4275.25px;">between Calgary and Banff, to serve a community of Stoney Indians for two years.
 At the end of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4626.01px;">assigned two years, the elders asked them to stay, but, since an Indian minister
 originally from the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">reserve wished to return, they resigned. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5527.54px;">As a result of an application to the United Church Board of World Missions, to
 do missionary work </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5878.30px;">somewhere in Asia, they were assigned to Japan.The first two years were spent in
 Tokyo studying the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6229.07px;">language and doing some counselling with an English Church youth group. In 1970
 they were placed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6579.83px;">in a ‘new town’ area of 130,000 people. The town was a suburb of Osaka — and they could see the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">sight of Expo ‘70 from their window. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7481.36px;">Here, from 1970 to 1975, Bob worked with a a Japanese Senior minister. Because
 the new towns had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7832.13px;">policy of “no church buildings” Bob organized the third “house church” — the congregation meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8182.89px;">in a rented hall. Because the building was used for other purposes during the
 week, Bob’s car trunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8533.66px;">became the storage area for the pulpit, the church library and tapes with the
 hymns and speakers to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">play them through. Each Sunday’s worship was preceded by a rapid few moments of furniture </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">moving! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9785.95px;">At Christmas, 1975, Bob was called to St. Andrews-Wesley in Vancouver* as an
 assistant minister </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10136.72px;">responsible for Outreach and Christian Education. During his one year furlough
 from Japan, he had </span>
