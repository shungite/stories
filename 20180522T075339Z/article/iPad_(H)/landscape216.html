        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">service of celebration (thanks to the fact that general council was being held
 at that time and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">president of conference was away). The service was televised nationwide on CBC,
 and as we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">lining up for a very formal procession, I found myself immediately ahead of the
 Knights of Columbus, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">with their sheathed swords. Turning to one of the K of C group, I said that if
 any of the Orange Lodge </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">people from Donegal were to see me on television along with the Knights of
 Columbus, they would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">have a fit! “Well, let’s give them something to talk about then,” he said, unsheathing his sword, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">putting the bare blade dangerously close to my neck!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">There is a sense in which we are still too close to our years at Westminster to
 get a proper perspective </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">on the life and work of the congregation. Suffice it to say that in the midst of
 all the programs and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">special events that we have touched on in these last dozen pages, my own time
 was naturally taken </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">up most of all with Sunday worship and pastoral care. There were many demands on
 one’s time: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">hospital visiting, as much home visiting as it was humanly possible to do,
 funerals, weddings, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">counselling, many long days and many late nights. We were blessed with very
 dedicated and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">competent staff associates, and a vast array of just as dedicated and competent
 lay workers. As </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">pointed out earlier, the new board structure made it very easy to bring new
 people into active </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">participation. The nominating committee was always eager to have new names
 passed on to them, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">and in my pastoral visiting. I kept an eye open for any likely candidate for a
 spot on the General </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">Board. These were great years, and retirement age closed in all too quickly.
 But, as someone </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">commented at our retirement party, the term should not be “re-tired,” but merely “re-treaded” for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">future work. It certainly turned out that way!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Perhaps a brief review of our own family should be given here, for during this
 sixteen-year tenure at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">Westminster, many things had happened.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">Miss Marion Forbes had been with us since 1950, moving along as part of our
 family and household </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">from Edmonton to Regina to Winnipeg. But, the time came when she didn’t want to be alone in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">house when we were away, and in 1968, with Fran’s wedding in London in the offing, she moved into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">the very fine (and new) Fred Douglas Lodge. We were always in close touch with
 her, and she was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">back to the house for special events, as her health permitted. Following an
 attack of pneumonia in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">the summer of 1970, she had to be moved to a nursing home for a month or two. I
 was with her </span>
