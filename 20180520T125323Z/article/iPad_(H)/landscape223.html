        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">In 1995 it was incorporated as a Government agency. The Centre can handle 50
 children. Twelve </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">spaces are reserved for children ages 4 and 5. They come to the Centre before
 school (nursery and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Kindergarten)  in the morning, have breakfast and are then taken to school by staff. They are
 then </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">picked up by stafff at 11:30, returned to the Centre and given lunch. They then
 stay at the Centre till </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">they are picked up by their parents after work.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2472.19px;">There are 38 spaces for children ages 6 to 12. They have the same regimen
 morning and noon but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">return to school for the afternoon. Then they are picked up at the end of school
 day and returned to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">the Centre where they are picked up by their parents.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3724.48px;">As a government agency the Centre now operates full time (during school holidays
 and summer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4075.25px;">vacation). According to staff the numbers of children attending varies during
 these ‘holiday’ times </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">but generally maintains the same level of attendance all year. There are no more
 volunteers and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">therefore no more direct participation of the Westminster congregation in the
 operation. The total </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">paid staff under Director Greg Blanco, is trained and professional.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">The  Staff sets a monthly meal plan (based on Canada food guide), does the shopping
 for groceries, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">and prepares and serves breakfast, lunch and after school snacks. The cost of
 the food program is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">approximately $13,000/annum . Food is prepared i the Church's basement kitchen
 and the children </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">eat in the area we know as our gymnasium.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">The program offered to the children is Government stipulated: “Children should learn through play” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">at the Centre. Learning through play is an age-old concept but sometimes
 misunderstood; we often </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">believe that play is play but learning is work. However, public school,
 kindergarten and nursery </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">school teachers will tell you how directed experience in the child’s environment can still be play and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">yet have structure and purpose. The Staff of the Centre is challenged as much as
 classroom teachers </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">are dealing with children who have different levels of development, experience
 and ability even </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">within a play environment.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">The Centre, then, becomes an integral part of the children’s development and works to develop </span>
