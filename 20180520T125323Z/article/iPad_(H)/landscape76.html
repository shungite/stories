        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">many words of praise for his sermons. There appeared to be good reason for his
 continued stature </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">in our congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">In fact Bonnell was a man driven by ideas; specifically he was interested not
 just in the theology </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">of religion per se, but rather more broadly in how religion impacted on the
 human condition. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">was a wonderful story teller, a keen observer of politics, a witness to the
 destructive impact of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">poverty on people — the period was of course mid Depression. He was an evangelical preacher </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">but also a moderate one. He was to become a confidant and advisor to Billy
 Graham but was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">not a fundamentalist. (Neither, Graham protested, was he!)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:3173.72px;">“When Rome’s youth became debased and enervated (drained of vitality), when regard was lost
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">for men’s honor and women’s purity, when the sanctity of the home was violated, when her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">literature became cynical and debased, her dominion ended.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4426.01px;">The moral life of any people rises or falls with the vitality or decay of its
 religious life.”(J.S. Bonnell)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4976.77px;">Bonnell’s sermons at Westminster often reflected his concern for social order. He spoke
 of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:5327.54px;">“suicide” of the social order; he showed concern for the breakdown of morality which some
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">prominent writers of his time were convinced was happening and should happen; in
 response to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">the Depression he agonized over mass unemployment and the human factor implicit
 in it; he also </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">recognized the social problems associated with alcohol and its use by both
 adults and youth. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6930.60px;">On June 19,1932 ( two days after I was born!) Bonnell preached on the topic “What Is Your Master </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7281.36px;">Passion?” In that sermon he analyzed the motives that operate in men’s lives. He then set forth a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">challenge calling men and women to dedicate their lives to a Passion for human
 betterment. For the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">ills of the human social condition Bonnell was convinced that religious faith
 was the only sure </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">remedy (and the source of the Passion of which he spoke.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">Elsewhere in the world people were troubled by the development of Nazism in
 Germany, Fascism </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">in Italy and Communism in Russia. Many of the world’s governments found the need to increase </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9585.95px;">their armaments and the size of their armies. We are reminded that Bonnell had
 twice toured Europe, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9936.72px;">once on his own and once in the company of Rev.Sherwood Eddy to look at the
 state of religion in </span>
