        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">participation. The nominating committee was always eager to have new names
 passed on to them, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:318.36px;">and in my pastoral visiting. I kept an eye open for any likely candidate for a
 spot on the General </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:669.13px;">Board. These were great years, and retirement age closed in all too quickly.
 But, as someone </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1019.89px;">commented at our retirement party, the term should not be “re-tired,” but merely “re-treaded” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1370.66px;">for future work. It certainly turned out that way!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Perhaps a brief review of our own family should be given here, for during this
 sixteen-year tenure </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2272.19px;">at Westminster, many things had happened.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2822.95px;">Miss Marion Forbes had been with us since 1950, moving along as part of our
 family and household </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3173.72px;">from Edmonton to Regina to Winnipeg. But, the time came when she didn’t want to be alone in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3524.48px;">house when we were away, and in 1968, with Fran’s wedding in London in the offing, she moved into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3875.25px;">the very fine (and new) Fred Douglas Lodge. We were always in close touch with
 her, and she was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4226.01px;">back to the house for special events, as her health permitted. Following an
 attack of pneumonia in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4576.77px;">the summer of 1970, she had to be moved to a nursing home for a month or two. I
 was with her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4927.54px;">when she died peacefully on October 2, 1970. She had been an important part of
 our whole family, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5278.30px;">and we were always grateful that our home could be her home for twenty years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5829.07px;">During the late sixties, Dorothy interspersed many church activities with the
 completion of five </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6179.83px;">courses at the University of Manitoba. That gave her the qualifications to be a
 teacher-librarian, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6530.60px;">from 1969–1979, first part-time, then full-time, she was on the Laura Secord Elementary
 School staff. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6881.36px;">With an honours BA from Queen’s, a BEd from the University of Alberta, and the library course </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7232.13px;">at U of M, she well merited a special Dorothy Vipond retirement party at Laura
 Secord.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7782.89px;">Mary had gone to Queen’s on a General Motors scholarship while we were in Regina, and her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8133.66px;">graduation in 1964 coincided with our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. She did
 her MA in history at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8484.42px;">the University of Toronto, and worked for a year and a half editing the foreign
 trade newsletter for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8835.19px;">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. But she soon recognized that she wanted an
 academic life, so </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9185.95px;">enrolled in a PhD program at U of T. She was a teaching assistant for a year at
 Scarborough College, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9536.72px;">then joined the history staff at Loyola in Montreal (later amalgamated with Sir
 George Williams to </span>
