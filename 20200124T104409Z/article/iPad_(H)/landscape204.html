        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">During these years in full ministry, the respect Nelson garnered in his
 profession was attested to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:327.60px;">by his being asked to serve as President of Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario
 Conference in 1960. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:687.60px;">Then, in 1974, he was asked to serve as President  of the Alberta and Northwest Conference. Further </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1047.60px;">to this unusual recognition for a minister to be asked to be President of two
 Conferences, Nelson </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1407.60px;">was presented in 1962 with the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by his Alma
 Mater, St. Andrew’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1767.60px;">College. And finally he was a member of the Senate of St. Stephan’s College in Edmonton </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2127.60px;">(a theological school that conducts post baccalaureate professional and academic
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2487.60px;">degree programs to  men and women for the practice of ministry).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3047.60px;">After his retirement (and later his death in January of 1991), two public
 documents cited </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3407.60px;">particular strengths in Nelson’s work aside from his standard ministerial activities. In an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:12291.29px;top:3407.60px;">in memoriam </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3767.60px;">document the following: Nelson was a widely read scholar and a recognized
 pastoral theologian … </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4127.60px;">Further on in the document the following: … his deep concern and care for persons, etc.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4687.60px;">These statements resonate with us in relation to Nelson’s work with Westminster. Grace Hospital </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5047.60px;">was located a few blocks from the Church in the Wolseley area. Nelson was a well
 known visitor </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5407.60px;">of patients there, not only to people who were members of Westminster
 congregation but to some </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5767.60px;">whose connection was tenuous. The writer’s mother, for example was in Grace dying of cancer. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6127.60px;">She had no connection to Westminster other than that of her son being a Choir
 member of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6487.60px;">Church. Yet one afternoon a “tall, grey haired, distinguished looking gentleman” visited her, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6847.60px;">an event that drew the staff’s particular attention and mother’s complete delight. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7207.60px;">And later my admiration for Nelson’s initiative. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7767.60px;">Our Assistant Minister at the time, Donald Keating, was very insistent that the
 Church should </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8127.60px;">move out of the building and into the community. (Donald initiated House
 Services of Worship </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8487.60px;">in homes in the local community.) Nelson, in his own way, and playing to his
 personal strengths </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8847.60px;">as a warm human being, spent a great deal of his time “moving out of the Church,” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9207.60px;">simply visiting the ill and the elderly, wherever they were.</span>
