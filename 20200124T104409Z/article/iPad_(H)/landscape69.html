        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:-32.40px;">We lay in suspense for about an hour anxiously waiting for the Australians to
 move on. The tanks </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:318.36px;">and cavalry at last did the trick, and the hillside which had proved such a
 tough nut to crack was at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:669.13px;">last covered with flying Huns. We could move on again in safety and did so,
 until for the first time </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:1019.89px;">our air superiority was challenged by a huge patrol of Hun plances. For a while
 they bombed us </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:1370.66px;">and machine gunned us, and made us wish we were anywhere but the position we
 were in. Our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:1721.42px;">airmen soon gathered in force, and after a tremendous battle drove the Hun away.
 It was a glorious </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:2072.19px;">sight, but what a tragic one, to see plane after plane crash to the ground in
 flames. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:2622.95px;">We were now way ahead of any active artillery support, but the tanks furnished
 our barrage, or </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:2973.72px;">rather took the place of it, and until nightfall we still kept advancing, though
 at a much slower rate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:3324.48px;">in face of the increasing opposition. Two of our companies were now in the first
 wave and did good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:3675.25px;">work, but when the halt was called for the day our turn had not come, so
 throughout we did not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:4026.01px;">come to close quarters with the Hun. Most of us knew the advance was nearing its
 end. Strong </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:4376.77px;">counter attacks were being thrown in, and the effect of the surprise was now
 over, as the Hun </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:4727.54px;">reserves were rapidly coming up.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Quotedletter-49" style="left:480.00px;top:5278.30px;">The Writing on the Wall </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:5829.07px;">As I write, both sides have settled down for the time being. What the near
 future holds for us we do </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:6179.83px;">not of course know. But the Hun has already been badly defeated, has lost
 immense stores of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:6530.60px;">materials and guns, and suffered many casualties; and this push which has more
 than placed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:6881.36px;">Amiens out of shell fire is certainly a bright omen for us, and the handwriting
 on the wall for Fritz, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7232.13px;">when next spring we have three million Americans to press our attack right
 through. It seems to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7582.89px;">me that we would have been able to get right through to the River Somme with
 very little trouble, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7933.66px;">had we only had the necessary number of fresh troops to keep him on the run. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:8484.42px;">Well, I have written too much already, as I may possibly have another show to
 write about before </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-20" style="left:480.00px;top:8835.19px;">long, in which we take a more active part.”</span>
