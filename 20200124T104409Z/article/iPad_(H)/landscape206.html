        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">A search of all the Sunday bulletins from January through to that day shows
 there was no mention </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:327.60px;">of Mercer’s intention to leave Westminster, no receptions or teas organized to say “good-bye.” Just </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:687.60px;">a curt announcement on the day of his leaving. I ask the question “What happened? Why the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1047.60px;">coldness of our Minister's departing?” I haven’t been able to find the answer in the memories </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1407.60px;">of any Church members surviving from that year.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1967.60px;">Whether or not we appreciated his work with us or whether there were “issues” that compelled </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2327.60px;">him to take such an abrupt leaving we’ll probably never know. What we do know is that once he as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2687.60px;">back in Alberta for the rest of his career the public outpouring  of praise for his services, both to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3047.60px;">Church and to other public institutions was unstinting as he took his leave for
 retirement. Nelson </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3407.60px;">Mercer cared deeply for people and his Ministry gave testimony to this wherever
 he worked.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:3948.61px;">R.D.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-0" style="left:651.95px;top:3948.61px;"> </span>
        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="left:660.95px;top:3948.61px;">— In His Own Words</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4548.21px;">R.D. (Bert) Macfarlane represents a significant portion of the congregation
 which has always been </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4898.97px;">the back bone of a successful Church — dedicated volunteers; the tireless men and women who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5249.74px;">run our programs and shoulder responsibilities for — among many reasons — the joy of serving. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5600.50px;">R.D. worked  in our Sunday School and our Athletic program for young people. He edited </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5951.27px;">a newsletter for many years. He also fathered a girl who became, like himself, a
 leader </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6302.03px;">every bit as strong as her father; Marilyn Macfarlane-Huband.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6852.80px;">Bert can tell his own story. The Annual Meeting he alludes to in the beginning
 took place </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7203.56px;">in 1972 during the Ministry of Reid Vipond, the same year this document was
 written …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="left:-30.76px;top:7754.33px;">“At the Annual Meeting of Westminster held in the Sanctuary this year Dr. Vipond
 was kind </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8105.09px;">enough to draw attention to the fact that I had completed 53 years of activity
 in this church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8455.86px;">and invited the congregation to give suitable recognition. I am deeply grateful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8806.62px;">to our minister for making this reference.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9357.39px;">Fifty three years is a short period in life’s record and I have enjoyed every bit of it and am thankful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9708.15px;">that I had the opportunity of being associated with such fine people in serving
 the Master.</span>
