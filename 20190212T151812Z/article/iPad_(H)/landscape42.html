        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">In 1893, at a meeting of the Maritime Synod of the Presbyterian Church, Clarence
 preached two </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:318.36px;">sermons that “revealed the Church in transition from the old theological method of preaching </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:669.13px;">with its “plan of salvation” to the new and more human form arising out of the great evangelical </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1019.89px;">movement …” Clarence was developing not only the style of his preaching, but also its
 distinct </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1370.66px;">thematic focus. He undertook three missions in Canada before deciding, once and
 for all, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1721.42px;">to stay in his land of birth; answering a call to preach in Middle Stewiacke,
 NS. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Nova Scotia’s rural population peaked in 1891, and was home around that time to numerous </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2622.95px;">businesses of national and international importance. Scotland, by contrast, was
 plagued with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2973.72px;">overcrowding, poverty, infant mortality, and sickness; factors that help to
 explain the massive </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3324.48px;">exodus of Scots during the 19th century to places like Nova Scotia and elsewhere
 in North America. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3675.25px;">In some regards, however, Nova Scotia must have struck our cultured British
 pastor as provincial, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4026.01px;">even backwards. Many of Scotland’s social ills were costs of the rapid, turbulent urbanization and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4376.77px;">industrialization it underwent in the 19th century, consistent with a pattern
 endemic to Western </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4727.54px;">Europe in that period. Meanwhile, Nova Scotia, while it had similarly undergone
 a period of intensive </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5078.30px;">industrialization from about the 1840s to the 1890s, was a society largely made
 up of farmers, fishers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5429.07px;">and miners, and was fast approaching a period of relative stagnation from which,
 in some senses, it </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5779.83px;">has never fully recovered. All the same, the sparsely populated Maritime
 landscape afforded distinct </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6130.60px;">pleasures for this amateur naturalist. He borrowed a microscope from a professor
 at the local </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6481.36px;">Agricultural College, and could often be spotted mucking about nearby swamps in
 search of “the real </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6832.13px;">grounds for Evolution.” Friends of his hinted “he knew the inhabitants of the swamp better than the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7182.89px;">occupants of the pew.” He was also reputed to appear at church spattered with mud from his bicycle </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7533.66px;">rides to work down the muddy trails that passed for roads at that time. This led
 him to comment that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7884.42px;">he was probably the first cleric in Nova Scotia to use “this new contraption” in the work of ministry.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8435.19px;">He had not completely given up his relationship to Albion however, and
 ultimately it was with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8785.95px;">a Scot he would share his life, after meeting and marrying Mary Tait on a single
 trip to Scotland </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9136.72px;">in 1896. Upon returning with his new wife to Canada and his ministry, perhaps
 fired up with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9487.48px;">loyalist sentiment as a result of his recent visit to Britain, Clarence recorded
 his thoughts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9838.25px;">about the somewhat recent “distractions in the west,” that is, Louis Riel’s decades-long </span>
