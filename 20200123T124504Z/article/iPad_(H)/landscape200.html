        <span class="char-of-Heading-27" style="top:360.00px;">IN WESTMINSTER UNITED CHURCH</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:959.60px;">1) Early in 1998 a sub-committee was created from our Outreach Committee with
 the mandate of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1310.36px;">looking into refugee sponsorships. In the spring of 1998 I met with Despic
 Mladen and his wife at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1661.13px;">church. After discussion it was decided the church would look at sponsoring his
 cousin, Lela Saric </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2011.89px;">and her family to Winnipeg. Lela had a husband and 3 daughters. They were
 trapped in Sarajevo, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2362.66px;">Yugoslavia during the civil war in that country.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2913.42px;">After discussion with the Outreach Committee and the Board of the Church a
 motion was put forth </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3264.19px;">to sponsor this family. A letter was sent the United Church head office in
 Toronto. On April 21, 1998 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3614.95px;">a Letter of Approval was received from the United Church. It was forwarded to
 Immigration Canada. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3965.71px;">On Sept. 3, 1999 a letter was received from Citizenship and Immigration that
 they had been </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4316.48px;">approved and would be arriving in Winnipeg on Sept.21, 1999. This was a happy
 day. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4867.24px;">Lela, her husband, Zeljko and daughters, Violeta, Jovana and Danijela arrived
 safely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5218.01px;">and were greeted with family members.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5768.77px;">With Betty Halstead’s efforts of fund raising we raised over $10,000.00. There was a lot of interest
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6119.54px;">and support from the congregation.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6670.30px;">This family has remained in Winnipeg and became employed with all the girls
 receiving </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7021.07px;">their education here in the city. This was a successful sponsorship.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7571.83px;">2) I received a letter in the church office on April 2, 2000 from an Allahyar
 Raza. I interviewed him </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7922.60px;">and his request from the church was to sponsor his brother, Khalil Raza who was
 a teenager trapped </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8273.36px;">in Moscow, Russia. He had been separated from his family during the Afghanistan
 war. Allahyar was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8624.13px;">prepared to support his brother financially, emotionally and culturally. He
 wanted the documentation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8974.89px;">done by Westminster United Church as Immigration Canada would not accept his
 application as he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9325.66px;">was a student at University of Winnipeg. The Outreach Committee and the Board of
 the Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9676.42px;">accepted this application and it went through the process with Immigration
 Canada. Due to the 9/11 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:10027.19px;">attacks in New York City in 2001 there were numerous delays. On Sept. 29th, 2003
 Khalil Raza arrived </span>
