        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">to Westminster in 1963, the same man had been clerk of Session for a dozen years
 or more and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:318.36px;">the same person had held the position as chairman of Stewards for ten years.
 Also, there were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:669.13px;">only three or four women on these boards.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1219.89px;">To discuss possible changes, we organized a four-hour session, which we called a
 Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1570.66px;">forum. This may have been where the idea was born, viz., to have one church
 board as the governing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1921.42px;">body of our congregation. Out of that idea we decided to have three groups meet—the executives of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2272.19px;">the UCW, of Stewards, and of Session—together with staff. It is not possible to describe all that </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2622.95px;">happened in that year of monthly meetings. But it soon became apparent how much
 overlapping </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2973.72px;">there was: e.g., both the UCW and the stewards had finance and property
 committees; both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Session and the UCW had a mission committee and a flower committee, to give only
 a couple of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3675.25px;">examples. As well, there were times when people had to report to both Stewards
 and Session, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4026.01px;">maybe, as well, to the Official Board. It was a clumsy and an inefficient type
 of organization. But, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4376.77px;">in setting up a new board structure, we had to make certain that all the work of
 the congregation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4727.54px;">would be covered, yet not duplicated. Also, we wanted to make certain that there
 would be a good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5078.30px;">mix of women, men, and young people on the board. We wanted to be certain, too, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5429.07px;">that there would be a time limit for any one person to serve.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5979.83px;">We began the discussion and study of a possible new structure of congregational
 government at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6330.60px;">beginning of 1969, and the final report was presented to the congregational
 meeting in January 1970. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6681.36px;">It was approved. The General Board (as we decided to call it) would be made up
 of nine committees, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7032.13px;">with four persons on each committee — worship, education, finance, property, communications, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7382.89px;">membership and visiting, fellowship, outreach, and nominations. There would also
 be a chairperson, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7733.66px;">vice chair, secretary, and treasurer, with the staff as ex officio members. Each
 board member would </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8084.42px;">serve a four-year term, and the chair would change every second year. Each of
 the nine committees </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8435.19px;">could add to their numbers for their own committee tasks, but all major
 decisions would be brought </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8785.95px;">to the monthly meeting of the General Board for final approval. This obviously
 is a very brief </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9136.72px;">description of a very major change in congregational government. (The text of
 the constitution </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9487.48px;">is in my Westminster file.)</span>
