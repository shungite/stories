        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">of course, extremely capable in terms of the church lawn. His hours were long;
 he was literally </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:318.36px;">on call anytime, all the time, from when the doors opened in the morning until
 the last meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:669.13px;">was over at night. He had Monday evening and all day Tuesday off. His
 replacement for those </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1019.89px;">times was old Mr. Fish. I was glad he was there, because it made possible my
 little joke: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1370.66px;">ours was the only church in town that employed Fish and Flipse!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Upon returning to Westminster in 1963, we still had a Dutch custodian, Rinke
 Zielstra. Mrs. Zielstra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2272.19px;">helped a good deal, especially in Rinke’s last years when his health was failing. They were succeeded </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2622.95px;">by Mr. and Mrs. Abe Thiessen, who in a year or two, became fed up with the
 sixty-eight steps to the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2973.72px;">fourth floor, and moved into their own home nearby. They also pointed out how
 very little </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3324.48px;">private life they had by living in the building where they worked.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3875.25px;">In the church office, Mrs. Violet Ridd had been secretary for eight or ten years
 before our arrival. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4226.01px;">However, a few months into my tenure she suddenly resigned. Mrs. Anna Burt was
 hired to replace </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4576.77px;">her, and for many years she served the church with great efficiency. She had
 been a Scottish war </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4927.54px;">bride, coming to Canada shortly after the war to marry Phil whom she had met
 when they were both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5278.30px;">in the Armed Forces. They had two daughters, Margaret and Anne. Phil was an
 orderly at the Deer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Lodge Veterans Hospital. Mrs. Burt was extremely efficient, and in short order
 had the office routine </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5979.83px;">down to a science. She was with us till the late seventies, though her
 continuing problem with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6330.60px;">arthritis finally forced her to work from a wheelchair. They bought a van with a
 side-lift to assist </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6681.36px;">in transporting her to the church until she reached retirement age. Her
 long-time dream was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7032.13px;">to tour Nova Scotia. (“I’ve toured all of old Scotland,” she used to say. “Now, if I could only see </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7382.89px;">New Scotland.”) The church’s farewell gift to her was airfare for her and Phil to Halifax, with a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7733.66px;">para-transit van waiting for them to do a two-week tour in the Maritimes.
 Unfortunately, upon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8084.42px;">arrival back in Winnipeg, she suffered a bout of pneumonia, and after being
 bed-ridden for a few </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8435.19px;">weeks, the arthritis became so severe she had to spend her remaining year and a
 half in bed. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8785.95px;">After her death, Phil began a life of travel, revisiting countries where he had
 served in WWII. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9136.72px;">He had been a very patient, caring, and long-serving husband.</span>
