        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:-32.40px;">of wing commander, joined our staff on a three-quarter time basis. A most
 affable Cape Bretoner, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:318.36px;">Mack was with us for five happy years. Following a very lengthy and debilitating
 illness with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:669.13px;">multiple sclerosis, his wife, Charlotte, died. Mack remarried, and he and Myrtle
 remain </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1019.89px;">two of our very good Winnipeg friends.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1570.66px;">We had a succession of staff members. When Mack retired, Jack Mathieson, who had
 served in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:1921.42px;">North Honan, China, was with us for three years. When Doris Marshall moved to
 Toronto to be near </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2272.19px;">her family and to do senior adult programming for the United Church, Susan
 Cawley became our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2622.95px;">deaconess. She was a recent graduate from Covenant College and was with us for
 two years. Susan </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:2973.72px;">married Harold Atwell from Trinidad, and when he finished his studies at the
 University of Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3324.48px;">they moved to Trinidad. Glenys Hughes, also from Covenant College, succeeded
 Susan, and less than </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:3675.25px;">two years later married Rev. Harry Oussoren and moved back to Toronto. Barbara
 Bryant also came to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4026.01px;">us when she completed her two-year course at Covenant College, but stayed for
 only one year. Upon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4376.77px;">leaving Westminster, Barbara attended Seneca College in Toronto and graduated in
 early childhood </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:4727.54px;">education. She married a minister and they serve jointly on a pastoral charge in
 Saskatchewan.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5278.30px;">When Barbara was leaving, and Jack Mathieson retired, the board decided we
 should move </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5629.07px;">into a new staffing arrangement and they called a relatively young ordained
 minister, Cecil Tiller. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:5979.83px;">He seemed anxious to move west from Saint John, New Brunswick, and to undertake
 a role similar </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6330.60px;">to the one that I had earlier done at Westminster, i.e., to be an associate
 minister with major </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:6681.36px;">responsibility for Christian education, to do as much visiting as possible, and
 to preach once </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7032.13px;">each month. This arrangement seemed to work well for a year or two, but Cec
 began to realize </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7382.89px;">that he really preferred preaching to CE work, and accepted a call to St. Andrewâ€™s Church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:7733.66px;">in Regina after two years at Westminster.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8284.42px;">At this point, we changed direction quite considerably in our staffing, and
 decided to hire three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8635.19px;">staff people working one-third time each. Joan McConnell, who had been a teacher
 before she and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:8985.95px;">Barry had four children, was our Sunday school superintendent, and she became
 our director of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Christian education. Audrey McLennan, who, before she and Norm had their three
 boys, had been </span>
