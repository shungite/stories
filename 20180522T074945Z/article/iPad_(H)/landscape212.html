        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">There were at least two important decisions regarding property and finances made
 by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">trustees and board at Westminster in our time there. First, the old manse at 120
 Maryland Street </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">was being used by Manitoba conference as the office for the conference staff and
 the resource centre. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">(141 Waterloo had been bought as a manse in about 1958.) After fairly lengthy
 negotiations with the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">conference executive, Westminster agreed to tear down the old manse and build a
 two-storey office </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">building to serve the conference needs. This was accomplished in 1964. The
 conference rent is used </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">to pay off the $80,000 mortgage on the office building, so it has been a win-win
 situation for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">church. The mortgage is just about paid off at this point (1992), and from now
 on, the conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">rental will become church income for Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Second, about 1965 I suggested that we should set up a foundation fund for the
 church. There were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">always people asking if there was some particular need toward which a memorial
 contribution could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">be made. Also, there were three or four small trust funds (not more than a total
 of $10,000–$15,000) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">and they were carried along year after year, reported at the annual meeting, but
 never used. No one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">quite knew what to do with them. It was my feeling that if there were a
 Foundation Fund properly set </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">up and publicized, there would be contributions made to it. Perhaps some people
 might put it into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">their wills. I knew that other churches had such a fund, including Knox in
 Winnipeg which had the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Duval Foundation, named for its first minister.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">After much discussion, the idea got off the ground. A constitution was drawn up.
 It went through </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">the proper channels in the provincial government so that it was legally
 chartered. Within a couple </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">of years, two or three $10,000–$15,000 bequests were given. When the manse was sold (for a mere </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">$38,000 in those years), that money was put in. Except in unusual circumstances,
 only the interest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">was to be used, and, even then, only for special expenses. In our years, most of
 the very fine stained-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">glass windows were cleaned and re-leaded using interest from the Foundation
 Fund. By the time </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">of my retirement in 1979, the foundation stood at well over $100,000. The 1991
 Annual Report shows </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">$300,000. Capital grants have been given to put a new roof on the church and to
 renew the heating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">system. I understand that interest from the fund is being used to underwrite
 some of the expenses </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">of the 1992 centennial year observances. Perhaps our airfare to the centennial
 is being paid </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">from the interest on the fund which I so strongly urged the board to establish!</span>
