        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">minister in the family, why pay five bucks to bring someone else in?” Indeed so!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:518.36px;">In the spring of 1978, I told the board at Westminster that I would be retiring
 in June 1979. After the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">summer, a pastoral relations committee was formed, but didn’t become very active until early 1979. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">They moved through the usual stages of meetings with presbytery representatives,
 setting out goals, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">looking at new directions. I was aware (as usually happens) of some of their
 plans, but kept out of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">way as much as possible. However, by the end of May 1979, they had made their
 choice—Rev. Bob </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Thompson, associate with Bob Shanks at St. Andrew’s-Wesley in Vancouver.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2822.95px;">We had the usual happy retirement parties. At Manitoba conference, at the end of
 May, I received my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3173.72px;">pen-and-pencil set. (Some three years before, about three dozen sets had been
 purchased from a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">jewellery store that was going out of business; “It will save the conference committee the trouble of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">looking for retiree gifts each year,” Fred Douglas remarked.) There was a staff party for both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Conlys and us at Orma Backhouse’s cottage at Victoria Beach, and several other groups had parties, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">too. The big event, however, was the salad supper at the church, serving six to
 seven hundred people. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">Following the meal, a program was held in the church, with presentations of
 roses to Dorothy; for me, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">a Sunday school picture book done by all the Sunday school kids; a Yashica
 camera from the board; a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">choir picture, and lots of lighthearted music from the choir; music from some of
 the Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">Chamber Orchestra, with a card signed by all the orchestra members; and finally,
 for us, a cheque for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">$6,000 from the congregation. What a night! During the supper hour, members of
 the planning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">committee took Dorothy and me to every table, stopping just long enough to say
 hello. It was a thrill </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">to be able to call practically every individual person by name—one advantage of a long pastorate.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">The next day we went down to Encore Travel and booked a three-week tour to
 Greece for September. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">It was a great finale to a fabulous sixteen years—actually sixteen years plus the three years as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">assistant. There were only two more weeks to go, and the days and nights were
 filled with luncheons </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">and dinner parties hosted by so many kind folk. We completed plans to rent our
 house to Dr. Brian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">Bevan, a middle-aged English doctor who was soon to bring his bride to Canada,
 and they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">happy to rent a completely furnished house for nine months while they decided
 where they might </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">wish to build or buy. We spent a few days packing all our clothes from clothes
 closets and bedroom </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">drawers, plus all my books and files from the vestry—a grand total of thirty boxes to be stored in the </span>
