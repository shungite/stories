        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Second, about 1965 I suggested that we should set up a foundation fund for the
 church. There were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">always people asking if there was some particular need toward which a memorial
 contribution could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">be made. Also, there were three or four small trust funds (not more than a total
 of $10,000–$15,000) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">and they were carried along year after year, reported at the annual meeting, but
 never used. No one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">quite knew what to do with them. It was my feeling that if there were a
 Foundation Fund properly set </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">up and publicized, there would be contributions made to it. Perhaps some people
 might put it into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">their wills. I knew that other churches had such a fund, including Knox in
 Winnipeg which had the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">Duval Foundation, named for its first minister.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">After much discussion, the idea got off the ground. A constitution was drawn up.
 It went through </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">the proper channels in the provincial government so that it was legally
 chartered. Within a couple </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">of years, two or three $10,000–$15,000 bequests were given. When the manse was sold (for a mere </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">$38,000 in those years), that money was put in. Except in unusual circumstances,
 only the interest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">was to be used, and, even then, only for special expenses. In our years, most of
 the very fine stained-</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">glass windows were cleaned and re-leaded using interest from the Foundation
 Fund. By the time </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">of my retirement in 1979, the foundation stood at well over $100,000. The 1991
 Annual Report shows </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">$300,000. Capital grants have been given to put a new roof on the church and to
 renew the heating </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">system. I understand that interest from the fund is being used to underwrite
 some of the expenses </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">of the 1992 centennial year observances. Perhaps our airfare to the centennial
 is being paid </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">from the interest on the fund which I so strongly urged the board to establish!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">I should mention, too, establishing the chapel. In both Edmonton and Regina,
 there was a separate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">chapel, so useful when you have a large sanctuary. Many smaller wedding and
 funeral services were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">conducted in the chapel. But there simply didn’t seem to be any suitable location for such a facility </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">at Westminster, unless we used either the church parlour, always called the
 Ladies Parlour, or the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">so-called primary room which was a multi-purpose room used for Sunday school,
 the library, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">counting offering on Sunday, quilting every Thursday, and for various committee
 meetings. After </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">some tactful discussion with the UCW, it was planned to use the parlour. We
 would have chairs </span>
