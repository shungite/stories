        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">(borrowed from Mordue’s Funeral Home). After a very impressive eulogy in which the church’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">earlier virtues were extolled, the casket was opened and those attending were
 invited to “please </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">come forward now to view the deceased.” How surprised we were when we looked in the silk-lined </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">casket to see ourselves, reflected in a mirror that had been appropriately
 placed at just the right </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">angle in the bottom of the casket!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">To return as senior minister after fourteen years was both an interesting and
 overwhelming </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">(if not frightening) experience. As the young assistant (I was only thirty-two
 when we first went </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">to Westminster in 1946), I had been given quite wide-ranging responsibilities.
 Dr. Howse was an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">excellent senior minister, and one never had the feeling of simply being the
 assistant to the minister. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">I, too, was a minister, and he had the happy faculty of inspiring confidence in
 me by the way in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">which he left whole areas of work for me to do. He was always available when I
 wanted (or needed) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">to consult with him, but I never felt that he was peeking around the corner to
 see what I was doing. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">I had work to do, and he left me to it: the overall Christian education program,
 Sunday and mid-week, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">work with new members and confirmation classes, home and hospital visiting, and
 a limited amount </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">of preaching, except in the summer when I preached morning and evening from the
 last Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">in June to Labour Day Sunday. In the summer, of course, I was in charge of all
 the work </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">of the church — Sunday services, weddings, funerals, hospital visiting — the whole bit.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">So, to return fourteen years later as senior minister gave opportunity for much
 reminiscing </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">about those three years as assistant. The young people of the forties were now
 mature adults, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">and as doctors and dentists and lawyers and housewives and teachers and business
 leaders, they </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">were active in the church as elders and stewards and UCW presidents. As the
 years moved along, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">I was conducting the funerals of elderly parishioners whom I had first known in
 the heyday of their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">working years. Two young lads whom I had confirmed graduated in law and were now
 “on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">bench.” Others had moved on in one profession or another, taking an active part in the
 family  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">business, or establishing their own. As I said, it was somewhat frightening to
 return to Westminster, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">but it turned out to be a most challenging and fulfilling — and lengthy — pastorate.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">I mentioned earlier, in the section on Lakeview, that I recognized the
 demographic changes that were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">coming in that congregation. At Westminster, I had the opportunity to witness
 the changes that had </span>
