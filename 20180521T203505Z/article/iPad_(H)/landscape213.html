        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">I should mention, too, establishing the chapel. In both Edmonton and Regina,
 there was a separate </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">chapel, so useful when you have a large sanctuary. Many smaller wedding and
 funeral services were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">conducted in the chapel. But there simply didn’t seem to be any suitable location for such a facility </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">at Westminster, unless we used either the church parlour, always called the
 Ladies Parlour, or the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">so-called primary room which was a multi-purpose room used for Sunday school,
 the library, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">counting offering on Sunday, quilting every Thursday, and for various committee
 meetings. After </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">some tactful discussion with the UCW, it was planned to use the parlour. We
 would have chairs </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">instead of permanent pews. There would be a drape (on a track) behind the
 communion table and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">lectern and organ that could be pulled around to the front of the chancel area
 to make the chapel a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">meeting room, and all would be well. A young architect with a good sense of what
 we desired did our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">design work. Sufficient families gave memorial contributions to cover the
 $18,000 cost; and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3826.01px;">Westminster now has a most attractive chapel which seats sixty or seventy
 people. By interesting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4176.77px;">coincidence, the first of many funerals I conducted in the chapel was that young
 architect’s aunt (one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4527.54px;">of the Riddell family). The second funeral was for the mother of Ted Millman,
 chairman of the chapel </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4878.30px;">building committee. There have been many weddings, including Doug and Jane’s on August 25, 1972. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5229.07px;">We have had Sunday school teachers’ communion services. Many groups use it for at least </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5579.83px;">the devotional part of their meeting. And on only one occasion that I know of
 did we pull </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5930.60px;">the sreredos drape to turn the chapel into an ordinary meeting room!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">Before we came to Westminster, there had been much discussion about
 discontinuing the Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">evening service. Attendance was often as low as twenty-five or thirty people,
 compared to the five </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">to seven hundred at 11 a.m. But there was the usual reluctance in the Session to
 take such a step </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">despite the low attendance and the fact that only a couple of elders ever
 attended. Also, as Dr. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7884.42px;">Leathers pointed out, twenty-five to thirty people is still ten times the
 biblical requirement! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8235.19px;">And anyway, maybe they should wait until the new minister came. Maybe he would
 have </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8585.95px;">some brilliant ideas about building up a thriving evening congregation,</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">I soon assured them that I had no magic tricks up my sleeve, and suggested that
 we should look </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">at an alternative to the service in the sanctuary. We began with a Sunday
 evening discussion group </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">in the lecture hall. We had a speaker, followed by small groups, followed by tea
 and cookies.</span>
