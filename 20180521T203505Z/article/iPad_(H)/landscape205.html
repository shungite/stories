        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">were to discover “Winnipeg’s finest” — the Edinburgh House on Wellington Crescent, and, as they say </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">in almost every advertisement, “much, much more.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">In a sense we were not fully prepared for the traumatic change at Westminster.
 Before we left </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">Lakeview we had canvassed the possibility of having a seniors’ club, but there were so few members </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">over sixty-five or seventy that such a club was considered neither necessary nor
 viable. In contrast, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">one of the most active groups at Westminster was the “Sunshine Club,” sixty or seventy-five seniors </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">who met every Friday afternoon, played cards, put on their own programs, and
 danced to the music </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">of their own orchestra. Their Christmas turkey dinner and June picnic swelled
 their numbers to over </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">one hundred.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">Doris Marshall was the staff person in charge of senior programming, and later
 (because she was a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">trained deaconess) added Christian education to her busy portfolio and gave
 excellent service to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">Westminster. By December, Mack MacIver, just retired from the air force
 chaplaincy with the rank of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">wing commander, joined our staff on a three-quarter time basis. A most affable
 Cape Bretoner, Mack </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">was with us for five happy years. Following a very lengthy and debilitating
 illness with multiple </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">sclerosis, his wife, Charlotte, died. Mack remarried, and he and Myrtle remain
 two of our very good </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Winnipeg friends.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">We had a succession of staff members. When Mack retired, Jack Mathieson, who had
 served in North </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">Honan, China, was with us for three years. When Doris Marshall moved to Toronto
 to be near her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">family and to do senior adult programming for the United Church, Susan Cawley
 became our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">deaconess. She was a recent graduate from Covenant College and was with us for
 two years. Susan </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">married Harold Atwell from Trinidad, and when he finished his studies at the
 University of Manitoba, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">they moved to Trinidad. Glenys Hughes, also from Covenant College, succeeded
 Susan, and less than </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">two years later married Rev. Harry Oussoren and moved back to Toronto. Barbara
 Bryant also came to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">us when she completed her two-year course at Covenant College, but stayed for
 only one year. Upon </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">leaving Westminster, Barbara attended Seneca College in Toronto and graduated in
 early childhood </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">education. She married a minister and they serve jointly on a pastoral charge in
 Saskatchewan.</span>
