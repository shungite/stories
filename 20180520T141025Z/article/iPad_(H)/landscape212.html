        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">we were frantically trying to finish our hectic day’s work to assure us that there really was no hurry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">after all. They had decided to have some redecoration done, and the painters
 weren’t coming for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">several days. Oh well, you can’t win ‘em all.</span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">I like to add footnotes, and this time there are two. First, don’t ever try to do your own moving, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">even if it is only five blocks away. And, second, we certainly didn’t realize at the time how extremely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">fortunate we were to have purchased our home when we did. We bought 718 Waterloo
 in 1971 for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">$23,900, and, exactly ten years later, sold it for $67,000. What a boon to have
 cash in hand to buy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">our retirement home in London, a much better home in every way, and almost
 completely </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">paid for by the sale of 718 Waterloo.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">There were at least two important decisions regarding property and finances made
 by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">trustees and board at Westminster in our time there. First, the old manse at 120
 Maryland Street </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">was being used by Manitoba conference as the office for the conference staff and
 the resource centre. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">(141 Waterloo had been bought as a manse in about 1958.) After fairly lengthy
 negotiations with the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">conference executive, Westminster agreed to tear down the old manse and build a
 two-storey office </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">building to serve the conference needs. This was accomplished in 1964. The
 conference rent is used </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">to pay off the $80,000 mortgage on the office building, so it has been a win-win
 situation for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">church. The mortgage is just about paid off at this point (1992), and from now
 on, the conference </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">rental will become church income for Westminster. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Second, about 1965 I suggested that we should set up a foundation fund for the
 church. There were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">always people asking if there was some particular need toward which a memorial
 contribution could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">be made. Also, there were three or four small trust funds (not more than a total
 of $10,000–$15,000) </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">and they were carried along year after year, reported at the annual meeting, but
 never used. No one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">quite knew what to do with them. It was my feeling that if there were a
 Foundation Fund properly set </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">up and publicized, there would be contributions made to it. Perhaps some people
 might put it into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">their wills. I knew that other churches had such a fund, including Knox in
 Winnipeg which had the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Duval Foundation, named for its first minister.</span>
