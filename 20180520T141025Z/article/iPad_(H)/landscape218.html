 at their home in NDG, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">and are the proud parents of Peter, born August 25, 1978, and Catherine, born
 May 26, 1980. Bill is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">also a grad of Queen’s (1964) and has an MA from the University of Toronto (1965). He teaches </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">mathematics in a CEGEP in Montreal.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Fran went to Queen’s on a provincial scholarship the summer we moved to Winnipeg (1963). She </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">worked one summer (1964) in Winnipeg prior to our family trip overseas, and the
 other summers did </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">typing and computer work for some professors in the English department at Queen’s. She graduated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">in honours history and English in 1967, and obtained a teaching position at
 Wheable Secondary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3051.20px;">School in London. On June 29, 1968, she and Don Menard (also a </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8984.43px;top:3051.20px;">67 history grad from Queen’s) were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3447.89px;">married in the chapel of First-St. Andrew’s in London. Following a year of social work in Toronto, Don </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3798.66px;">joined the Laurier Secondary staff in London. Fran was at Wheable until they
 became the proud </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4149.42px;">parents of David (August 15, 1974) and Beth (December 22, 1976.) Fran has been
 extremely active in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4500.19px;">church and community work as well as being available for substitute teaching.
 Even more important </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4850.95px;">for Dorothy and me personally, Fran keeps in close touch with our “going out” and our “coming in.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5201.72px;">She checks our house and our mail and does our banking when we are away. Without
 her assistance, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5552.48px;">we would not be able to do our worry-free travelling. Besides being head of
 history at Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5903.25px;">Secondary School now, Don is also available for chores at 406 Wortley that are
 too heavy for an </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6804.78px;">Doug did his BA at the University of Winnipeg, and by dint of his work for
 several summers on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7155.54px;">university farm, went to York in 1970. He completed his PhD in psychology, and,
 following a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7506.31px;">postdoctoral year at Boulder, Colorado, joined the staff of St. Thomas
 University in Fredericton. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7857.07px;">and Jane Bowden were married in the chapel of Westminster in Winnipeg on August
 25, 1972. Jane is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8207.84px;">from Winnipeg, a graduate of U of T in early childhood education and from the
 Toronto Royal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8558.60px;">Conservatory as a clarinetist and now has a large clarinet class. They, too, are
 proud parents—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8909.37px;">Nicholas, May 24, 1979, and Samuel, October 18, 1983.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9460.13px;">Rob finished Grade 12 at Kelvin in Winnipeg in 1971 and enrolled at U of T in
 political science. His </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9810.90px;">summer employment was in Winnipeg in government-sponsored educational projects.
 After </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10161.66px;">graduation in 1975, he spent a year in Geneva at the Graduate Institute of
 International Affairs, </span>
