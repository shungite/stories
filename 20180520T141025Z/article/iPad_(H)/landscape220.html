        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">The next day we went down to Encore Travel and booked a three-week tour to
 Greece for September. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">It was a great finale to a fabulous sixteen years—actually sixteen years plus the three years as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">assistant. There were only two more weeks to go, and the days and nights were
 filled with luncheons </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">and dinner parties hosted by so many kind folk. We completed plans to rent our
 house to Dr. Brian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Bevan, a middle-aged English doctor who was soon to bring his bride to Canada,
 and they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">happy to rent a completely furnished house for nine months while they decided
 where they might </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">wish to build or buy. We spent a few days packing all our clothes from clothes
 closets and bedroom </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">drawers, plus all my books and files from the vestry—a grand total of thirty boxes to be stored in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">furnace room! Everything else was left “as is”—bedding, dishes, pictures on the walls, etc. At $375 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">per month, we think the Bevans had a good deal. We trusted that they would look
 after things well, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">and we found out when we came home on April 30, 1980, that everything was in
 good order.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">The pulpit supply committee had arranged for Sunday services for July 1979, but
 since we were in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">town, I had offered to take funerals and weddings, and it turned out to be one
 of those very busy </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">months. But I was not about to leave people scrambling to find someone to
 conduct a funeral, or to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">have a stranger for their wedding when we were in the city anyway. So it worked
 out okay.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">As an appendix to this chapter I shall include my second-last sermon at
 Westminster, which I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">entitled, “The First Forty Years are the Hardest.” There will not be much overlapping with what has </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">been written thus far, but perhaps it gives a kind of summary. (Let me confess
 here that ten years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">later, in 1989, when I was completing my second post-retirement job, at
 Metropolitan in London, I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">used almost exactly the same sermon, simply changing the title to “The First Fifty Years are the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Hardest.”)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">But just before the Appendix, I must relate what appeared in the Westminster
 Church calendar on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">my last Sunday, and this actually found its way into a September 1979 issue of
 PUNCH magazine in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">England.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">I had given the church secretary the general outline for the calendar material,
 including hymns, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">lessons, sermon subject, etc. And then I said, “Why not indicate that it’s my last Sunday at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">Westminster?”</span>
