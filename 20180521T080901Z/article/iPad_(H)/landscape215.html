        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">support working mothers. After a year of planning, getting the program
 officially recognized by the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">provincial government, and with funding in place by the church, the government
 and the mothers, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">the project began. Major funding was eventually picked up by the government,
 with the church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">supplying all the facilities and the volunteers. We began with one staff person
 and twenty-five </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">or so children. The program has grown, and for many years has had two workers
 and forty to fifty </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">children. A large group of volunteers assist at meal time. All equipment has
 been upgraded to fulfill </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">the Board of Health requirements. Members of the congregation carry most of the
 responsibility </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">for the work of the child care board. It is such a well-established program that
 one couldn’t </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">imagine Westminster without it.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">The church sanctuary, halls, and meeting rooms are used by many groups in the
 city. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra has its four or five concerts each year in the
 sanctuary, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">the orchestra members use most of the facilities for rehearsing. At times, it
 was somewhat a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">nuisance, but this was offset for me by the personal joy to give over my vestry
 to many guest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">artists. I remember best of all Liona Boyd, Ivan Moravec, Elmer Iseler, and the
 Canadian Brass.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Several high schools still have their June graduations in the sanctuary. Mrs.
 Litz’s Mennonite </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Children’s Choir made several of their records in our church. The Winnipeg Ladies Choir,
 mainly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">a Mennonite choir, also used the sanctuary. The acoustics are excellent, and
 even more important, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">the welcome mat was always out.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Many other community groups use the excellent facilities at Westminster. At
 election time, we had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">all-candidates’ meetings. Several organizations, such as the Peace Action Committee, use space
 on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">our third-floor meeting hall (called the concert hall after the stage was
 erected in the early seventies). </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">For a number of years, the gym was used each Sunday afternoon for recreation and
 refreshments for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">ex-psychiatric patients, men and women, who used to be at the Selkirk Mental
 Hospital, but who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">were now living in the community. The program, ‘Mothers’ Morning Off,’ is still going strong. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">And again, the list goes on.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">Despite the number of pages in this account of “Westminster Revisited,” I have said nothing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">my involvement with the mission board. In 1965 I was asked to be the conference
 convenor of the </span>
