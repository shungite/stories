        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Finally, at Christmas time in 2004, Lorraine made up her mind that 2005 was
 going to be the year, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">and in a matter of a week or two, through a friend of a friend, she was given
 the name of Dwight </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">DeLong, an American who has started a foundation in Romania for caring for
 orphans. She emailed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">him and asked if he had any volunteer work for a 59 year old woman who just
 wanted to cuddle </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">babies. He said come ahead, and that she did. Another woman from the church
 asked if she could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">join the expedition, and plans moved so quickly for the two of them, that
 Lorraine’s passport arrived </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">on a Friday, just in time for her Monday departure. She flew from Kelowna to
 Vancouver to Frankfurt </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">to Budapest in Hungary, where she was picked up by a van, and driven just three
 hours, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">over the Romanian border to Oradea. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">When Lorraine and Betty arrived in Oradea, they discovered that, in fact, caring
 for babies under </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">two years of age, was a new undertaking for the Foundation, and much of the two
 months they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">there, was spent orienting the Romanian workers to this new undertaking. They
 worked on a floor of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">the children’s hospital in Oradea which housed babies up to the age of two years. The great
 majority </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">of these babies had been born to Roma (gypsy) parents. The Roma custom is for
 the women to marry </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">very young, and so they have large families, born into extreme poverty. The work
 of the foundation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">was to help the babies develop socially and physically so that they were healthy
 in more than a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">medical sense, as they moved back home, or into foster homes, and they had some
 degree of success. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">Dwight did distance work for a computer software development firm in Washington
 State, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">and 80% of his salary went to pay Romanians who worked for the foundation. When
 Lorraine and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">her friend Betty returned to Canada, one of their goals was to raise enough
 money to supplement </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">Dwight’s salary, so that the work they were doing as volunteers, could be taken over by
 Romanian </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">workers. Churches, service clubs, and individuals in our area helped them
 largely reach that goal. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">In 2006, Lorraine went back to her babies in Romania. She spent over a month
 there in May — this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">time alone — but she was really happy to see the unbelievable difference that one year had
 made in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">the reactions of the babies. She said that she would never had thought of
 adopting any of the babies </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">she saw the previous year, because they would all have psychological problems
 resulting from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">neglect. But in one year, the fact that babies were being held to be fed,
 cuddled and played with, </span>
