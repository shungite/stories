        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">somewhere in Asia, they were assigned to Japan.The first two years were spent in
 Tokyo studying the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">language and doing some counselling with an English Church youth group. In 1970
 they were placed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">in a ‘new town’ area of 130,000 people. The town was a suburb of Osaka — and they could see the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">sight of Expo ‘70 from their window. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">Here, from 1970 to 1975, Bob worked with a a Japanese Senior minister. Because
 the new towns had a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">policy of “no church buildings” Bob organized the third “house church” — the congregation meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">in a rented hall. Because the building was used for other purposes during the
 week, Bob’s car trunk </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">became the storage area for the pulpit, the church library and tapes with the
 hymns and speakers to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">play them through. Each Sunday’s worship was preceded by a rapid few moments of furniture </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">moving! </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">At Christmas, 1975, Bob was called to St. Andrews-Wesley in Vancouver* as an
 assistant minister </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">responsible for Outreach and Christian Education. During his one year furlough
 from Japan, he had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">worked there while taking training in high-rise apartment ministry.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">And now the Thompsons have come to the Prairies with their three children;
 Jillian-11, Amanda-5, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">and Joshua who arrived on July 19th adding a further challenge to the already
 horrendous task of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">moving from Vancouver to Winnipeg.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">The official induction of the Rev. Robert Thompson as our minister will take
 place in our Church on </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">Sunday, October 14 at 7:30 PM with members of Presbytery officiating.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-29.49px;top:7281.36px;">*More recently St Andrews-Wesley has been the home church of Rev. Gary Paterson,
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7632.13px;">United Church Moderator.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8182.89px;">During Bob’s stay at Westminster he participated with lay people to develop Celebration </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8533.66px;">Worship using contemporary and traditional music and various forms of Liturgy
 for more </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8884.42px;">informal, intergenerational services. They began with a mid-week service and
 latterly </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9235.19px;">held services in the gymnasium of the church on Sundays at the same time as the
 traditional service </span>
