        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Perhaps a brief review of our own family should be given here, for during this
 sixteen-year tenure at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Westminster, many things had happened.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:869.13px;">Miss Marion Forbes had been with us since 1950, moving along as part of our
 family and household </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">from Edmonton to Regina to Winnipeg. But, the time came when she didn’t want to be alone in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">house when we were away, and in 1968, with Fran’s wedding in London in the offing, she moved into </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">the very fine (and new) Fred Douglas Lodge. We were always in close touch with
 her, and she was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">back to the house for special events, as her health permitted. Following an
 attack of pneumonia in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">the summer of 1970, she had to be moved to a nursing home for a month or two. I
 was with her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">when she died peacefully on October 2, 1970. She had been an important part of
 our whole family, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">and we were always grateful that our home could be her home for twenty years.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">During the late sixties, Dorothy interspersed many church activities with the
 completion of five </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">courses at the University of Manitoba. That gave her the qualifications to be a
 teacher-librarian, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">from 1969–1979, first part-time, then full-time, she was on the Laura Secord Elementary
 School staff. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">With an honours BA from Queen’s, a BEd from the University of Alberta, and the library course at U </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">of M, she well merited a special Dorothy Vipond retirement party at Laura
 Secord.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">Mary had gone to Queen’s on a General Motors scholarship while we were in Regina, and her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">graduation in 1964 coincided with our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. She did
 her MA in history at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">the University of Toronto, and worked for a year and a half editing the foreign
 trade newsletter for the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. But she soon recognized that she wanted an
 academic life, so </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">enrolled in a PhD program at U of T. She was a teaching assistant for a year at
 Scarborough College, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">then joined the history staff at Loyola in Montreal (later amalgamated with Sir
 George Williams to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">become Concordia University.) Completing her PhD after a couple of years
 teaching, she has </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">continued on staff there. She and Bill Butler were married on October 9, 1977,
 at their home in NDG, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">and are the proud parents of Peter, born August 25, 1978, and Catherine, born
 May 26, 1980. Bill is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">also a grad of Queen’s (1964) and has an MA from the University of Toronto (1965). He teaches </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">mathematics in a CEGEP in Montreal.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">Fran went to Queen’s on a provincial scholarship the summer we moved to Winnipeg (1963). She </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10238.25px;">worked one summer (1964) in Winnipeg prior to our family trip overseas, and the
 other summers did </span>
