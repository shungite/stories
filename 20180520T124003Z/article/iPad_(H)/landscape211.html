        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">to the monthly meeting of the General Board for final approval. This obviously
 is a very brief </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">description of a very major change in congregational government. (The text of
 the constitution is in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">my Westminster file.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">I have included this summary of our church board restructuring because it
 changed in a major way </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">the focus of my work at Westminster. It gave a whole new direction to the life
 and work of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">congregation. I was really impressed with the way in which a structure, or
 system of government, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">can change the life of a church. For many years, the congregation seemed to be
 pulled in three </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">directions by the Session, by the UCW, and by the Stewards. Now, there was only
 one board. There </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">were no financial secrets tucked away in the Stewards’ safekeeping. There was no Session, so any </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">members of the congregation could be, and were, asked to serve the elements on
 Communion </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">Sunday. The UCW had no secret agenda, because there was no UCW! The units were
 still meeting, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">but they came under the fellowship committee. There were still “districts” and “district visiting,” but </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">the visitation was arranged by the membership and visiting committee. And, best
 of all, we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">finding new people every year to become board members, and all the board members
 were aware of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">all the work in the church. In short, we became a much more open society. And
 with this new breath </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5429.07px;">of fresh air blowing in the church, it gave me new impetus, and was the chief
 reason, I think, why I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">found it easy to continue on at Westminster for a few more years, and eventually
 till retirement when </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">I reached age sixty-five in 1979.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">There were changes in our household, too. Doug, who had enrolled in Grade 9 at
 River Heights Junior </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">High when we came to Winnipeg in 1963, went on to Kelvin High and then to do his
 BA at the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">University of Winnipeg, graduating with the gold medal for highest standing in
 the general arts </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">course. He had worked each summer (on the end of a hoe) at the University of
 Manitoba farm, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">had a bank account to go to York University in Toronto in the fall of 1970 to
 pursue a PhD in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">psychology. So, in our huge manse at 141 Waterloo Street (3,200 square feet of
 floor space and a 100 × </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">150 foot property), we were down to one family member at home. Rob had proceeded
 through </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">elementary, junior high, and was now (1970–1971) in his final year at Kelvin High School and had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9487.48px;">made his decision to go east for his university work. We certainly didn’t need this huge manse. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9838.25px;">Dorothy was already on part-time staff at Laura Second as teacher-librarian,
 having taken the </span>
