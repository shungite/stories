        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">consult with him, but I never felt that he was peeking around the corner to see
 what I was doing. I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">had work to do, and he left me to it: the overall Christian education program,
 Sunday and mid-week, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">work with new members and confirmation classes, home and hospital visiting, and
 a limited amount </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">of preaching, except in the summer when I preached morning and evening from the
 last Sunday in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">June to Labour Day Sunday. In the summer, of course, I was in charge of all the
 work of the church—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Sunday services, weddings, funerals, hospital visiting — the whole bit.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">So, to return fourteen years later as senior minister gave opportunity for much
 reminiscing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">those three years as assistant. The young people of the forties were now mature
 adults, and as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">doctors and dentists and lawyers and housewives and teachers and business
 leaders, they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">active in the church as elders and stewards and UCW presidents. As the years
 moved along, I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">conducting the funerals of elderly parishioners whom I had first known in the
 heyday of their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">working years. Two young lads whom I had confirmed graduated in law and were now
 “on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">bench.” Others had moved on in one profession or another, taking an active part in the
 family  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">business, or establishing their own. As I said, it was somewhat frightening to
 return to Westminster, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">but it turned out to be a most challenging and fulfilling—and lengthy—pastorate.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">I mentioned earlier, in the section on Lakeview, that I recognized the
 demographic changes that were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">coming in that congregation. At Westminster, I had the opportunity to witness
 the changes that had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">already taken place. In the late 1940s, the change was beginning. Young people
 coming out of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">Armed Forces were looking for property in the suburbs. The bulk of our
 congregation in those years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">still lived mostly in the Westminster-Fort Rouge-River Heights areas, with only
 relatively few as far </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">out as Fort Garry or Deer Lodge. Subdivisions like Silver Heights, Kirkfield
 Park, and Windsor Park </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">were only names. Oxford, Westworth, and Trinity Churches were nonexistent.
 Transcona was a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">separate town and we had only a smattering of members coming from what Larry
 Zolf calls </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:8435.19px;">“Winnipeg’s nort’end.”</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">What a change we witnessed (and were part of) in our second tour of duty at
 Westminster! I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">remember well that day early in July 1963, as we drove into Winnipeg from the
 west: homes and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">stores and schools and churches right out to Kirkfield Park; there were
 apartment houses (albeit </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">mostly three-storey walk-ups); Polo Park shopping mall already established at
 Portage and St. James; </span>
