        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Obviously, Ernest’s choosing to go to Union is a reflection on his own theological matrix. He was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">there for one year, became a close friend of Fosdick, wrote his thesis on 18th
 Century English Deists, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">was awarded the degree Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.) and fell in love with
 an intelligent and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">attractive girl from Pasadena California named Esther Black (who was taking her
 Masters degree from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Columbia University).</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">He and Esther travelled together at the end of term for a vacation to Pasadena
 and her home. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">While there, the family’s minister (a Presbyterian) invited Ernest to be the preacher for two Sundays </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">during his summer vacation.. (Two years later this contact lead to an invitation
 for him to become </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">the minister of the Presbyterian Church in Beverly Hills.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">After summer vacation Ernest went back to NFLD to visit his parents before
 heading to Edinburgh </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">for his Doctorate. Think, for a moment, of a young man of obviously above
 average intellect, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">no stranger to the rigours of scholarship and intense study, who finishes a
 bachelor’s degree, plus </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">theological training, plunges immediately into a Master’s degree program which he completes </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">in one year, and then heads across the Atlantic to work on a Doctoral thesis.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5478.30px;">While in Edinburgh, to finance himself , he took employment as the Chaplain in
 Saughton Prison. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5829.07px;">He had to preach every second Sunday and had to visit new inmates just arrived.
 he could also spend </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">time with older inmates which he did. He even had his own set of keys to doors
 within the building- </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">except those in Death Row. Furthermore to earn more money he preached (on
 supply) at various </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">churches in Scotland.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">It should be noted that he had his wife, Esther with him. He had not wanted to
 marry her till </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7782.89px;">after he had finished his doctoral program. However, Esther’s parents were wealthy. They agreed </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">to support their daughter while she and Ernest were in Scotland. Hence their
 marriage </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">and the two of them off to Scotland.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">They arrived in Scotland September of ‘32. Ernest enrolled in the university and decided, with help </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">from a university tutor, to do his doctoral thesis on The Clapham Sect a group
 of men who were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">social reformers. He did his research through the National Library of Scotland
 and at the British </span>
