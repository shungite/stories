        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">They moved into our manse at 120 Maryland Street … “over 40 large storm windows that had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">to be put on and taken off each year. It also had a furnace, a vast cave into
 which we shovelled </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">a ton of coal a week.” Ernest seemed to forget the hardships of living on the Rock.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">These experiences that Ernest alludes to were pure Winnipeg in the 1930s. The
 windows of our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">homes were single glazed. While they kept out the mosquitoes the heat poured in
 in summer and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">the bone-chilling cold in winter. The storm windows were our answer to
 double-glazing. Heavy wood </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">frames, not too difficult to set in place on a single story dwelling but awkward
 and exhausting to put </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">up in fall and take down in spring where a ladder was necessary to reach the
 second story of many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">homes. Three story homes were even more difficult. And all those windows had to
 be cleaned every </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">fall, both the installed ones and the storm ones.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">The coal shovelling was another labor intensive activity. Basements had a
 walled-in enclosure called </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">a coal bin. The coal was delivered in sacks which hardy men carried up to the
 house foundation from </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">the back lanes. The coal was then dumped through the ‘coal chute’ (a small window) into the bin. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">Usually by the ton. Sometimes more than a ton at a time. Every winter morning
 Father would go </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">to the basement and shovel coal into the furnace. We wouldn’t get up till we felt the warm air rising </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">through a maze of pipes and out of ‘registers’ in each room. In most homes, coal shovelling </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">happened more than once every day. We simply didn’t understand the efficacy of proper insulation </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">in our buildings. We could deal with flying insects but climate was a challenge.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">Howse’ found that his routine was far from simple. To start with; two sermons, Sunday
 morning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">and evening every week. Easter Sunday, always two morning services. (A practice
 started </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">by Howse’s predecessor.)</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Seating capacity in the sanctuary was upwards to 1100 and at times that was
 inadequate for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">the congregation. Seats would be set up in the back area of the church and sound
 piped in.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">Peak Sunday attendance were at the Communion services, which, in the Scottish
 fashion, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">Westminster celebrated four times a year, following a solemn preparatory service
 on Friday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">nights. But what we did at Communion was a practice, long-since abandoned. Each
 member of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10087.48px;">congregation would present a card on admission to the service. (Forget your
 card, here is another to </span>
