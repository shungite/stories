        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:-32.40px;">engaged at their own particular tasks. By now the shell fire had ceased, a sure
 sign that Fritz was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:318.36px;">making off in his best time. Here and there we passed a few dead Huns who had
 fought to the last </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:669.13px;">by their machine guns, but these were the exception. Our tanks, which were in
 the battle in force, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:1019.89px;">played their part well, and any stubborn machine guns were their special prey.
 We marched on all </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:1370.66px;">day and were able to rest for the night without being called upon to take an
 active part in the fight. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:1721.42px;">This, however, we expected to do on the morrow. We had passed through many
 recaptured villages, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:2072.19px;">through Hun Division H.Q. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:2622.95px;">Hun stores of every description, including a base canteen, which was certainly a
 find to us. We </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:2973.72px;">were able to stock up with cigars, cigarettes, honey, and tinned stuffs
 sufficient to last us many </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:3324.48px;">days. Near here we were able to inspect a hospital train captured by the
 cavalry; also a train which </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:3675.25px;">had pulled into the station, filled with reinforcements as our cavalry patrols
 galloped into the town. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Quotedletter-49" style="left:480.00px;top:4226.01px;">Tanks and Cavalry Win the Day </span>
        
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:4776.77px;">On the following morning we started off again, now in support. Everyone was in
 the brightest </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:5127.54px;">spirits, and declared they would march till they dropped if need be. Never
 before had the Allies </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:5478.30px;">driven though so far, and we were still going. We soon found, however, that the
 opposition was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:5829.07px;">stiffening. He had many guns in position and the fire was well directed with
 some high ground in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:6179.83px;">the rear. We passed some Fritz guns presently, busily pumping lead into their
 late owners, a sight </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:6530.60px;">which cheered us all. The enemy fire became heavier, and from artillery
 formation to extended order </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:6881.36px;">and thence to advance by section rushes, was the only way we were able to keep
 going. Our patrol </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7232.13px;">on the left then brought in word that the troops on our flanks could get no
 further, and this </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7582.89px;">presently we could see for ourselves, as a violent burst of machine gun fire
 made everyone hug the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:7933.66px;">ground and made plain our flank was in the air. We decided to await
 developments, as it was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:8284.42px;">dangerous to advance further. A patrol of cavalry dashed past quite unmindful of
 the whistling </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:8635.19px;">bullets which emptied many of their saddles. It always seemed to me such a sad
 sight to see the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:8985.95px;">horses stop and turn round and look enquiringly at their fallen riders, and then
 trot aimlessly away. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:9536.72px;">We lay in suspense for about an hour anxiously waiting for the Australians to
 move on. The tanks </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:9887.48px;">and cavalry at last did the trick, and the hillside which had proved such a
 tough nut to crack was at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="left:480.00px;top:10238.25px;">last covered with flying Huns. We could move on again in safety and did so,
 until for the first time </span>
