        <div class="QxpTextBox">
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">In the church office, Mrs. Violet Ridd had been secretary for eight or ten years
 before our arrival. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">However, a few months into my tenure she suddenly resigned. Mrs. Anna Burt was
 hired to replace </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">her, and for many years she served the church with great efficiency. She had
 been a Scottish war </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">bride, coming to Canada shortly after the war to marry Phil whom she had met
 when they were both </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">in the Armed Forces. They had two daughters, Margaret and Anne. Phil was an
 orderly at the Deer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Lodge Veterans Hospital. Mrs. Burt was extremely efficient, and in short order
 had the office routine </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">down to a science. She was with us till the late seventies, though her
 continuing problem with </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2422.95px;">arthritis finally forced her to work from a wheelchair. They bought a van with a
 side-lift to assist in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2773.72px;">transporting her to the church until she reached retirement age. Her long-time
 dream was to tour </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3124.48px;">Nova Scotia. (“I’ve toured all of old Scotland,” she used to say. “Now, if I could only see New </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3475.25px;">Scotland.”) The church’s farewell gift to her was airfare for her and Phil to Halifax, with a
 para-transit </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3826.01px;">van waiting for them to do a two-week tour in the Maritimes. Unfortunately, upon
 arrival back in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4176.77px;">Winnipeg, she suffered a bout of pneumonia, and after being bed-ridden for a few
 weeks, the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4527.54px;">arthritis became so severe she had to spend her remaining year and a half in
 bed. After her death, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4878.30px;">Phil began a life of travel, revisiting countries where he had served in WWII.
 He had been a very </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5229.07px;">patient, caring, and long-serving husband.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5779.83px;">Pat Hodges arrived in Winnipeg with her husband, Houston, just as the search
 committee </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6130.60px;">was looking for a new church secretary. Houston was a United  Methodist minister from Texas, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6481.36px;">and had come to be the social action secretary of Winnipeg presbytery. Joan
 McConnell met the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6832.13px;">Hodges, discovered that Pat had been a church secretary in the deep south and
 was hoping to get </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7182.89px;">employment in Winnipeg. It was a perfect fit, and for our last two years at
 Westminster, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7533.66px;">the phone was answered with a happy and cheery southern drawl.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">For many years, indeed, from its beginning in 1892, Westminster had a Session
 and a Deacon’s </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">Court. The Deacon’s Court was something like an official board in that it consisted of all members
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">of Session, plus people who were on the finance and property committee. There
 was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9136.72px;">no Committee of Stewards; this function was performed by the Deacon’s Court.</span>
