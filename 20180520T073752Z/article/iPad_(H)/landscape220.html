        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Rob finished Grade 12 at Kelvin in Winnipeg in 1971 and enrolled at U of T in
 political science. His </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">summer employment was in Winnipeg in government-sponsored educational projects.
 After </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">graduation in 1975, he spent a year in Geneva at the Graduate Institute of
 International Affairs, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">returned to Toronto to do an MA, then to Harvard to study government. He joined
 the U of T political </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">science department in 1981 and completed his PhD about two years later. He met
 Gina Feldberg at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">Harvard, and they were married on June 26, 1983 at Harvard Chapel. Gina has
 since completed her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">PhD in the history of medicine, and is on staff at York University in Toronto.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">I had the joy of performing all four weddings—in London, Winnipeg, Montreal, and Boston. Why not? </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">Someone asked Doug who was going to conduct his wedding. “My dad, of course. When you’ve got a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">minister in the family, why pay five bucks to bring someone else in?” Indeed so!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">In the spring of 1978, I told the board at Westminster that I would be retiring
 in June 1979. After the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">summer, a pastoral relations committee was formed, but didn’t become very active until early 1979. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">They moved through the usual stages of meetings with presbytery representatives,
 setting out goals, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">looking at new directions. I was aware (as usually happens) of some of their
 plans, but kept out of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">way as much as possible. However, by the end of May 1979, they had made their
 choice—Rev. Bob </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Thompson, associate with Bob Shanks at St. Andrew’s-Wesley in Vancouver.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6179.83px;">We had the usual happy retirement parties. At Manitoba conference, at the end of
 May, I received my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">pen-and-pencil set. (Some three years before, about three dozen sets had been
 purchased from a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">jewellery store that was going out of business; “It will save the conference committee the trouble of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">looking for retiree gifts each year,” Fred Douglas remarked.) There was a staff party for both the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">Conlys and us at Orma Backhouse’s cottage at Victoria Beach, and several other groups had parties, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">too. The big event, however, was the salad supper at the church, serving six to
 seven hundred people. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8284.42px;">Following the meal, a program was held in the church, with presentations of
 roses to Dorothy; for me, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8635.19px;">a Sunday school picture book done by all the Sunday school kids; a Yashica
 camera from the board; a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">choir picture, and lots of lighthearted music from the choir; music from some of
 the Manitoba </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Chamber Orchestra, with a card signed by all the orchestra members; and finally,
 for us, a cheque for </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">$6,000 from the congregation. What a night! During the supper hour, members of
 the planning </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">committee took Dorothy and me to every table, stopping just long enough to say
 hello. It was a thrill </span>
