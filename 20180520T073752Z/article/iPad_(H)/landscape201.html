        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">on plans and projects — Colonel J.D. Sinclair, T.D. Patton, M. McCracken, B.V. Richardson, Wm. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">Bonellie, J. R. Major, and I was included as I was running the gym classes twice
 a week.  Class space </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">was hard to find. Two classes in the kitchen, 6 or 7 on the gym floor (Lower
 Hall), one each in the hall, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">the men's washroom, the vestry, and the  shower dressing room ( the latter usually erupted  in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">weekly disaster). Wm. Hurst was assistant on records and he usually caused an
 upset when coming </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">in weeding through the classes wearing a large racoon coat. Curriculum teachers’ book were poor </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">and teachers hard to find.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">We had four religious denominations teaching at a time. We followed the Tuxis
 and Trail Ranger </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">badge award systems and several times we held annual Bible examinations. This
 was apparently </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">unique as Manitoba College (a Presbyterian college) sent over prof. Dr. Fred
 Kerr and one other to look </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">us over. We had over 100 boys take part.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">One afternoon one class had a sound recorder take a record of pupils taking part
 in the lesson. One </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">lad had the part of repeating the Lord's Prayer; he had been interrupted , lost
 the trend and could not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">continue. Dr. Christie (Westminster’s third Minister) happened to drop in so we gave him a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">demonstration of class working. When he listened to a boy who could not repeat
 the Lord’s Prayer </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">(on the recording)  he demanded the name of the parents so he could call on them. The culprit was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">his youngest son!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6530.60px;">Competition in indoor and outdoor athletics between our groups and other
 churches in the city was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6881.36px;">keen. Churches did all this in early days. Community Clubs and schools did
 little; in fact few </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7232.13px;">Community Clubs existed. Sunday School leagues had a large organization take
 care of athletic </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">meets, swim meets, basketball, hockey, soccer, lacrosse for the entire city. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8133.66px;">Westminster generally did very well and some photos are in our church vestibule.
  Winning medals </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">were provided in all leagues by the Griffon Club of Winnipeg to all sections
 from Midget to Senior. We </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">had a tough time in the hockey. One Sunday afternoon Miss Jessie Riddell, in
 charge of Sunday </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">School records, required the reason for seven new names suddenly appearing on
 our rolls with no </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">parent reference.They were the members of St. Margaret's Sunday School, ( =a
 neighbouring church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9887.48px;">on Westminster St.) who had won the cup the previous year in Hockey, and they
 decided to play for </span>
