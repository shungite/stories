        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">enrolled in a PhD program at U of T. She was a teaching assistant for a year at
 Scarborough College, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">then joined the history staff at Loyola in Montreal (later amalgamated with Sir
 George Williams to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">become Concordia University.) Completing her PhD after a couple of years
 teaching, she has </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">continued on staff there. She and Bill Butler were married on October 9, 1977,
 at their home in NDG, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">and are the proud parents of Peter, born August 25, 1978, and Catherine, born
 May 26, 1980. Bill is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">also a grad of Queen’s (1964) and has an MA from the University of Toronto (1965). He teaches </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2072.19px;">mathematics in a CEGEP in Montreal.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">Fran went to Queen’s on a provincial scholarship the summer we moved to Winnipeg (1963). She </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">worked one summer (1964) in Winnipeg prior to our family trip overseas, and the
 other summers did </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">typing and computer work for some professors in the English department at Queen’s. She graduated </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">in honours history and English in 1967, and obtained a teaching position at
 Wheable Secondary </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4103.50px;">School in London. On June 29, 1968, she and Don Menard (also a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Regulartext-60" style="left:8922.13px;top:4080.11px;">ʼ</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:8984.43px;top:4103.50px;">67 history grad from Queen’s) were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4500.19px;">married in the chapel of First-St. Andrew’s in London. Following a year of social work in Toronto, Don </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4850.95px;">joined the Laurier Secondary staff in London. Fran was at Wheable until they
 became the proud </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5201.72px;">parents of David (August 15, 1974) and Beth (December 22, 1976.) Fran has been
 extremely active in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5552.48px;">church and community work as well as being available for substitute teaching.
 Even more important </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5903.25px;">for Dorothy and me personally, Fran keeps in close touch with our “going out” and our “coming in.” </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6254.01px;">She checks our house and our mail and does our banking when we are away. Without
 her assistance, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6604.78px;">we would not be able to do our worry-free travelling. Besides being head of
 history at Westminster </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6955.54px;">Secondary School now, Don is also available for chores at 406 Wortley that are
 too heavy for an </span>

        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7857.07px;">Doug did his BA at the University of Winnipeg, and by dint of his work for
 several summers on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8207.84px;">university farm, went to York in 1970. He completed his PhD in psychology, and,
 following a </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8558.60px;">postdoctoral year at Boulder, Colorado, joined the staff of St. Thomas
 University in Fredericton. He </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8909.37px;">and Jane Bowden were married in the chapel of Westminster in Winnipeg on August
 25, 1972. Jane is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9260.13px;">from Winnipeg, a graduate of U of T in early childhood education and from the
 Toronto Royal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9610.90px;">Conservatory as a clarinetist and now has a large clarinet class. They, too, are
 proud parents—</span>
