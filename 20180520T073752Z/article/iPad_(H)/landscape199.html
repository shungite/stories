        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">R.D. (Bert) Macfarlane represents a significant portion of the congregation
 which has always been </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">the back bone of a successful Church — dedicated volunteers; the tireless men and women who </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">run our programs and shoulder responsibilities for — among many reasons — the joy of serving. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">R.D. worked  in our Sunday School and our Athletic program for young people. He edited </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">a newsletter for many years. He also fathered a girl who became, like himself, a
 leader </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1721.42px;">every bit as strong as her father; Marilyn Macfarlane-Huband.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">Bert can tell his own story. The Annual Meeting he alludes to in the beginning
 took place </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">in 1972 during the Ministry of Reid Vipond, the same year this document was
 written …</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:-41.01px;top:3173.72px;">“At the Annual Meeting of Westminster held in the Sanctuary this year Dr. Vipond
 was kind </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3524.48px;">enough to draw attention to the fact that I had completed 53 years of activity
 in this church </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3875.25px;">and invited the congregation to give suitable recognition. I am deeply grateful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4226.01px;">to our minister for making this reference.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4776.77px;">Fifty three years is a short period in life’s record and I have enjoyed every bit of it and am thankful </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5127.54px;">that I had the opportunity of being associated with such fine people in serving
 the Master.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5678.30px;">When I arrived in Winnipeg in 1919 I made a habit of visiting various churches
 to determine </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6029.07px;">what part of the city I would live in.I dropped into Westminster one September
 evening and was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6379.83px;">delighted to find that a Boys' Conference was being held and the speaker was Mr.
 Taylor Staten. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6730.60px;">He is the man who started Tuxis and Trail Rangers — a great friend of mine. He spotted me </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7081.36px;">in the congregation and told the Conference the story of three lads from Calgary
 </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7432.13px;">who came to the Lake of The Woods in 1910 to a Boys’ Conference. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7982.89px;">He related that two of them had given their lives in the First World War, and he
 had had</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8333.66px;">a visit with the remaining one a few months earlier while lecturing to troops
 during the march </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8684.42px;">of occupation in Germany; I had obtained leave and had travelled 20 kilometres
 to listen to my friend. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9035.19px;">Taylor Staten then asked me to come up to the pulpit and say a few words.
 Although that was my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9385.95px;">introduction to Westminster, I really had the Westminster table pinned on me
 many years </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9736.72px;">before I ever heard of this church.</span>
