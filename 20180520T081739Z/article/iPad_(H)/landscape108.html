        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">Saskatchewan Conference that the Forget mission would be well served by an
 ordained minister. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">To his surprise he was quickly replaced and was then relocated to Northern
 Saskatchewan, a mission </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">field with four preaching points. It was summer and he worked there till he was
 ready in the fall </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">to return to college.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">His plan was to enrol at Victoria College in Toronto. However, he received word
 that his father was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">very ill. So he opted instead to enrol at Mt. Allison in New Brunswick to be
 closer to family.Then he </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">faced a mind change. Mt.Allison had been a Methodist College and Ernest had been
 a Methodist. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">But the United Church now existed and he decided to turn his back on methodism
 and seek a new </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">experience at what had been a Presbyterian college. He turned to Pine Hills
 Theological College near </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">Halifax, “an institution where no Newfoundland probationer had ever before gone. ” An advantage </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">to enrolling in Pine Hills was that it was affiliated with Dalhousie University,
 the one </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">for Theology the other for general studies.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4576.77px;">He arrived at Pine Hills and was interviewed by Principal McKinnon, who had been
 our </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4927.54px;">(Westminster’s) second minister. “I took a taxi, drove up to Pine Hills and asked to see Principal </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5278.30px;">Clarence McKinnon. Principal McKinnon was an extraordinary man.He was among the
 most </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">influential teachers I have ever met, and certainly one of those whom I would
 most feely call my </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">friend. He was not an original scholar but I suspect there were few scholars of
 his time who could </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">match him, as in church history class he could touch dead things of the past and
 bring them to life. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">More important than anything academic was the immeasurable impact of his
 character. Critics at </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">the time used to say that all Pine Hill students became little imitations of
 Clarence McKinnon.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7582.89px;">Ernest was able to get his BA in 3 years and in five years both his B.A, from
 Dalhousie and the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7933.66px;">honours Diploma from Pine Hill. He graduated in Arts in 1929 and in Theology in
 1931.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8484.42px;">One further look at Ernest’s summer ‘jobs.’ In 1928 he was assigned as minister to Piapot, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8835.19px;">Saskatchewan (downtown Piapot pictured overleaf), west of Swift Current. His
 transportation in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9185.95px;">area was again by horse. The owner of the grocery store, a fellow by the name of
 A.J. Mercer decided </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9536.72px;">to play a trick on the young minister. Ernest had boasted that he could ride any
 horse around. Mercer </span>
