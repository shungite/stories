        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">and Elaine Hickerson, wife of Rev. Bill Hickerson, secretary of Manitoba
 conference, came as her </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">replacement. Audrey McLennan also left in 1978 to work full- time at her home
 church, Fort Garry, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">and Orma Backhouse replaced her. Partly as a footnote, and as a point of
 interest, Joan McConnell is </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1019.89px;">now personnel secretary of Manitoba conference. Audrey McLennan later became
 president of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1370.66px;">Manitoba conference, and now chairs the department at head office that produces </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-20" style="top:1721.42px;">Spirit Connection</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="left:2154.96px;top:1721.42px;"> on Vision TV.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">The music department saw fewer changes than any other part of the staff. Herb
 Sadler was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">organist and choir director from 1919–1953. Glen Harrison then assumed the position of choir </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">director — and is still there! Barry Anderson was organist for several years, and was
 succeeded in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">1967 by Don Menzies, who is also still in that position. With a fine,
 four-manual Casavant organ, and </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">excellent organists and choir directors, Westminster has had superlative music
 throughout its long </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">history. In our years, Glen Harrison directed many special choir recitals, and
 on numerous occasions </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">had a half dozen Winnipeg Symphony players for orchestral accompaniment. Don
 Menzies, as well </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">as guest organists, have played (and broadcast) many recitals. I have heard both
 Marcel Dupré </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">and E. Power Biggs in recital on that outstanding instrument.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">Writing this much about staff, I’ll also add a word here about our custodians. When we were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">first at Westminster, Mr. Jake Flipse looked after the church. A native of
 Holland, he had worked </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">with a landscape gardening company when he first came to Canada. I’m not sure when he came </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">to the church, but Mr. and Mrs. Flipse occupied the three-room apartment on the
 fourth floor of </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">the church hall for many years. Mr. Flipse was quiet, unassuming, very kind,
 very efficient, and, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">of course, extremely capable in terms of the church lawn. His hours were long;
 he was literally </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">on call anytime, all the time, from when the doors opened in the morning until
 the last meeting </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">was over at night. He had Monday evening and all day Tuesday off. His
 replacement for those </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">times was old Mr. Fish. I was glad he was there, because it made possible my
 little joke: </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8785.95px;">ours was the only church in town that employed Fish and Flipse!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">Upon returning to Westminster in 1963, we still had a Dutch custodian, Rinke
 Zielstra. Mrs. Zielstra </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">helped a good deal, especially in Rinke’s last years when his health was failing. They were succeeded </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">by Mr. and Mrs. Abe Thiessen, who in a year or two, became fed up with the
 sixty-eight steps to the </span>
