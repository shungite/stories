        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:-32.40px;">forward now to view the deceased.” How surprised we were when we looked in the silk-lined casket </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:318.36px;">to see ourselves, reflected in a mirror that had been appropriately placed at
 just the right angle in the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:669.13px;">bottom of the casket!</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1219.89px;">To return as senior minister after fourteen years was both an interesting and
 overwhelming (if not </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1570.66px;">frightening) experience. As the young assistant (I was only thirty-two when we
 first went to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:1921.42px;">Westminster in 1946), I had been given quite wide-ranging responsibilities. Dr.
 Howse was an </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2272.19px;">excellent senior minister, and one never had the feeling of simply being the
 assistant to the minister. </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2622.95px;">I, too, was a minister, and he had the happy faculty of inspiring confidence in
 me by the way in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:2973.72px;">which he left whole areas of work for me to do. He was always available when I
 wanted (or needed) to </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3324.48px;">consult with him, but I never felt that he was peeking around the corner to see
 what I was doing. I </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:3675.25px;">had work to do, and he left me to it: the overall Christian education program,
 Sunday and mid-week, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4026.01px;">work with new members and confirmation classes, home and hospital visiting, and
 a limited amount </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4376.77px;">of preaching, except in the summer when I preached morning and evening from the
 last Sunday in </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:4727.54px;">June to Labour Day Sunday. In the summer, of course, I was in charge of all the
 work of the church—</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5078.30px;">Sunday services, weddings, funerals, hospital visiting — the whole bit.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5629.07px;">So, to return fourteen years later as senior minister gave opportunity for much
 reminiscing about </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:5979.83px;">those three years as assistant. The young people of the forties were now mature
 adults, and as </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6330.60px;">doctors and dentists and lawyers and housewives and teachers and business
 leaders, they were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:6681.36px;">active in the church as elders and stewards and UCW presidents. As the years
 moved along, I was </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7032.13px;">conducting the funerals of elderly parishioners whom I had first known in the
 heyday of their </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7382.89px;">working years. Two young lads whom I had confirmed graduated in law and were now
 “on the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:7733.66px;">bench.” Others had moved on in one profession or another, taking an active part in the
 family  </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8084.42px;">business, or establishing their own. As I said, it was somewhat frightening to
 return to Westminster, </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8435.19px;">but it turned out to be a most challenging and fulfilling—and lengthy—pastorate.</span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:8985.95px;">I mentioned earlier, in the section on Lakeview, that I recognized the
 demographic changes that were </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9336.72px;">coming in that congregation. At Westminster, I had the opportunity to witness
 the changes that had </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:9687.48px;">already taken place. In the late 1940s, the change was beginning. Young people
 coming out of the </span>
        <span class="char-of-Caption-22" style="top:10038.25px;">Armed Forces were looking for property in the suburbs. The bulk of our
 congregation in those years </span>
